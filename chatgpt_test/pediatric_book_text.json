endeavor. Many struggles and barriers in ac\u00ad\ncessing comprehensive health care for children continue \nto plague families across the United States. Current data \nfrom the U.S. Census Bureau (2016) reveal that as many \nas 19.7% of American children younger than age 18 are \nliving at the poverty level and 5% to 7% of American \nfamilies have inadequate health care for their children \n(Kaiser Family Foundation, 2017). Other challenges faced \nby many families include food insecurity, homelessness, \nunsafe neighborhoods, unemployment, and single-parent \nhouseholds. These stressors, as well as concerns about the \npromotion of health and security of safety for children, \nadd to the complexity of providing holistic care. Nurses \nmust be confident and well prepared to assist a family, \nno matter what the family\u2019s constellation, economic \nstatus, or level of health. Pediatric nursing is challeng\u00ad\ning, rewarding, and increasingly more complex in the \ncurrent times.\nThe foundation for excellence in clinical care of chil\u00ad\ndren and their families starts with knowledge of growth \nand development according to the expected milestones \nand clinical presentation for each stage. Knowledge of \nthe significant anatomic, physiologic, developmental and \ncognitive differences between children and adults will \nprovide the new pediatric nurse with information on \nwhich to base the child\u2019s assessments and care. Children \nare not \u201clittle adults.\u201d The pediatric nurse must use both \nunique theoretical and skills-based foundations to make \nsafe decisions about these vulnerable patients.\nThis text presents material for the new pediatric \nnurse, whether that nurse is new to the profession or is \ntransitioning from adult care to pediatric care. It provides \nvital information about the various settings in which \nthe pediatric nurse can encounter children\u2014inpatient \nacute care, pediatric intensive care, school nursing, \noutpatient nursing, and so on. As most children do not \nexperience a hospitalization during their developmental \nperiod, it is important for a pediatric nurse to be well \nprepared to conduct assessments, implement the nursing \nprocess, work as an interdisciplinary team member, and \nprovide care to both the child and the family regardless \nof the setting. The book stresses the importance of us\u00ad\ning family-centered care as a foundation for respect, no \nmatter what the family is facing or experiencing in their \nlives. Empowering and enabling parents or caregivers to \nprovide care for their child are two important concepts \nof family-centered care.\nThis text has been written by a very experienced pe\u00ad\ndiatric nurse. The author is both a professor of pediatric/\nfamily healthcare nursing and an actively practicing pe\u00ad\ndiatric nurse in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. She \nworks in the inpatient pediatrics unit at California Pacific \nMedical Center with children who have a wide variety of \nacute, surgical, and traumatic injuries. She also works per \ndiem for Lucille Packard Stanford Hospital at a pediatric \nhematology oncology clinic in San Francisco; her role \nthere is as a clinical coordinator providing children with \noutpatient chemotherapy, education, and supportive care \nduring cancer treatment.\nMany pediatric and family healthcare textbooks are \ncurrently available. What is unique about this text is \nthat it provides a concept-based perspective as well as a \ngreat deal of information on pathologies and diagnoses \nunique to children. Its many features provide the latest \ninformation on family education, research, safety, and \npharmacology. The author has used a variety of national \nstandards of practice as well as position papers by national \npediatric organizations to inform the content provided. \nChapters unique to this text include those focusing on \nsymptoms assessment and management for children, \nworking and communicating in interdisciplinary teams, \ncaring for children across healthcare settings, cultural \ncare models, essential safety models. and pediatric-\nspecific skills. Each chapter has been written to provide \nthe essential components of pediatric nursing theory as \nwell as the corresponding skills. The carefully selected \nappendices also enhance the text by providing specifics \non pediatric calculations, nutrition, safe and effective \nhandoffs, growth charts, prevention of errors, and tips \n", "xiv\t\nPreface\nfor maintaining professional boundaries, among other \nresources.\nThe author hopes that the reader finds this text to \nbe a helpful guide and a reference for attaining \ndeeper understanding of the unique aspects of pediatric \nnursing.\nReferences\nKaiser Family Foundation.

Children are part of families, \nand families are unique in their composition, strengths, \nand needs. Children progress from total dependence on \ncaregivers as babies to independence as young adults. \nThis time period\u2014from birth to young adulthood\u2014is \ndynamic and can be challenging. Pediatric nurses must be \nprepared to provide support, education, and meticulous \ncare to children from diverse cultural, racial, and ethnic \nbackgrounds, and from diverse family structures. Some \nfamilies are able to provide for their children\u2019s basic needs \nsuch as health care, whereas others experience stressors \nthat adversely influence their children\u2019s health and well-\nbeing (Figure 1-1). Contemporary times have brought both \neconomic and health challenges that can greatly influence \na pediatric nurse\u2019s experiences in caring for children and \ntheir families.\nIn today\u2019s world, any given child may experience many \nsocioeconomic factors that influence his or her health. \nCurrent research shows that large numbers of families \nin the United States and elsewhere are experiencing \nunemployment, frequent moves, food insecurity, and \nlack of consistent health care and insurance. Hunger\u2014\na basic human experience\u2014has been documented as \na national problem with adverse health and cognitive \nconsequences, affecting physical, academic, and social \nfunctioning during childhood (Coleman-Jensen, Rabbitt, \nGregory, & Singh, 2015a, 2015b; Kushel, Gupta, Gee, & \nHaas, 2006; Melchior et\u00a0al., 2012; Weinreb et\u00a0al., 2002) \nand contributing to long-term mental health issues \nfrom adolescence into adulthood (McIntyre, Williams, \nLavorato, & Patten, 2013). A comprehensive plan for \na child\u2019s health should include early assessments and \nscreenings, immunizations, disease prevention, acute \ncare for illness and injuries, and, if needed, chronic care \nfor lifelong conditions that first present in childhood. \nThe term anticipatory guidance is used to denote the \nprocess of preparing parents, guardians, or caregivers \nfor what to expect as the child grows, develops, and \nmatures (Figure 1-2).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nDefinitions of Anticipatory Guidance\nAnticipatory guidance is a phrase used to define informa\u00ad\ntion provided to parents so they can expect, plan for, and \ncope with actual or potential problems associated with \nnormal growth and development of a child before those \nproblems arise. As a child progresses from infancy to \nadolescence, particular points along the developmental \npath require preparation. Anticipatory guidance gives the \nhealthcare team the opportunity to teach parents or care\u00ad\ngivers about what to expect. For instance, teaching about \nthe increasing mobility of infants, which progresses from \nrolling over to crawling to walking, will help parents plan \nfor a safe environment and prevent falls or other accidents. \nTeaching parents about toddlers\u2019 needs for constant super\u00ad\nvision and their inherent clumsiness can help parents plan \nto prevent accidents and injuries. \nFigure 1-1\u2002\n\u00a9 Nolte Lourens/Shutterstock\nFigure 1-2\u2002\n\u00a9 Monkey Business Images/Shutterstock\nPediatric nurses must be committed to viewing their \npatients and families in a holistic and comprehensive light. \nThe key to understanding the complexity of providing \npediatric nursing care is to understand the important role \nthat childhood plays in a developing person.

Attention difficulties, adolescent mood and \nanxiety disorders, suicide, homicide, access to firearms, \nschool bullying and violence, and the effects of media on \nobesity, sexual activity, and violence are all considered \ncontemporary issues that create concerns about health \nand injury and, therefore, are titled new morbidities. \nContemporary scholars and practitioners have since added \nto Haggerty\u2019s list and incorporated evidence-based best \npractices to address these issues, leading to a revised set \nof \u201cNew Morbidities 2.0\u201d (Giardino & Sanborn, 2013). \nNurses, as part of their roles in caring for children, are \nin a good position to assess for morbidity concerns and \nprovide direction, support, referrals, and counseling. \nFour general categories of concerns related to these new \nmorbidities have been identified (Lucey, 2001):\n\u2022\t Physical and environmental factors affecting be\u00ad\nhavior and risk taking, such as access to drugs and \nillegal substances, cigarettes, and alcohol\n\u2022\t Variations of behavior and emotional development: \nhelping parents adapt to the unexpected and learn \nuniqueness of each child\u2019s development\n\u2022\t Child behaviors affecting physical risk, such as \nsmoking, drug use, and medical adherence\n\u2022\t Severe behavioral deviations and their management \nneeds\nHealthy People 2020\nHealthy People 2020 is a federal initiative that promotes \na set of national goals and objectives for improving the \nhealth of all people living in the United States over a 10-year \nperiod.

One major concern that arises on an international \nscale is poverty. Currently, approximately 20% of U.S. families \nare living in poverty. On a global scale, poverty affects ap\u00ad\nproximately 50% of the world\u2019s pediatric population. There are \ncurrently 2.2 billion children in the world, 1 billion of whom \nlive in poverty (Shah, 2013).\nResearch shows that \u201cpersistent poverty\u201d has more det\u00ad\nrimental effects on a child\u2019s socioemotional functioning, \nIQ, and school achievement than \u201ctransient poverty.\u201d Poor \nchildren experience less home-based cognitive stimula\u00ad\ntion, lower teacher expectations, inconsistent parenting, \nand poorer academic-readiness skills\u2014all factors that can \nslow their development (Kursmark & Weitzman, 2009). \nFigure 1-3\u2002\n\u00a9Inti St Clair/Blend Images LLC/Getty\n4\t\nChapter 1\u2003 Introduction to Children\u2019s Health Care\n", "Goals for Maternal, Infant, and Child Health\nImprove the health and well-being of women, infants, children, and families.\n\u203a\u203a\nDetermines the health of the next generation and helps to predict public health challenges for families in the future \n(morbidity, mortality, poverty, and ethnic disparities).\n\u203a\u203a\nRisks of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, as well as pregnancy-related complications, can be reduced \nby increasing access to care and identifying early any health conditions of infants related to disease, disability, or \ndeath.\n\u203a\u203a\nThe health, nutrition, and behaviors of mothers highly influence the physical and cognitive development of infants. \nBreastfeeding has been widely acknowledged as beneficial for growth, health, development, and immunity (Figure 1-4). \nPromoting breastfeeding is a primary goal.\n\u203a\u203a\nSome objectives include:\n\u2022\t\nReduce the rate of fetal and infant deaths\n\u2022\t\nReduce cesarean births among low-risk women\n\u2022\t\nReduce the number of infants with low birth weight and very low birth weight\n\u2022\t\nReduce preterm births\n\u2022\t\nIncrease abstinence from alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs among pregnant women\n\u2022\t\nIncrease the proportion of infants who are breastfed\nGoals for Early and Middle Childhood\nImprove the health and well-being of the early (birth to year 8) and middle (ages 6 to 12) childhood developmental \nperiods.\n\u203a\u203a\nThe period of early and middle childhood provides the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive foundation for lifelong \nhealth and well-being.\n\u203a\u203a\nGoals include research and interventions in reducing obesity, increasing physical activity, and preventing injury and \nviolence.\n\u203a\u203a\nThe three top developmental milestones of this period include motor skills, language development, and emotional \nregulation and attachment.

As a family grows, interacts, and \nhas experiences, the formation of family strengths provides \na foundation for growth. These assets provide an optimal \nsupport system for individuals within the family as well as \nfor the family as a whole (Figure 1-5).

Many \npotential constellations exist, including nuclear, group, \nextended, blended, adoptive, foster, single-parent, same-\nsex parents, and untraditional such as a reconstituted or \ncommunal. Given today\u2019s high rates of marital separation \nand divorce, growing up in a binuclear family, in which \na child\u2019s living time is divided between two or more \nhouseholds, is not uncommon. The most important con\u00ad\nsideration when assessing the structure of a child\u2019s family \nis highlighted by a commonly used phrase: A family is \nwho they say they are.\nBEST PRACTICES\nDetermining the Family\u2019s Primary \nCare Decision Maker\nOne aspect of caring for families is determining who the \ndecision maker is. This person may not always be one of \nthe child\u2019s parents or the direct care provider. Cultural \nsensitivity is important when making this determination, \nas compliance and adherence may be based on engaging \nand showing respect toward the primary care decision \nmaker of the family. \nFigure 1-5\u2002\n\u00a9 FatCamera/E+/Getty\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nFamily Strengths\nOne quality associated with family strength is positive \ncommunication. Communication that is respectful and \nuses active conversation and listening skills to process and \ntalk about important issues, without attacking others, is \nconsidered a key family strength (Sittner et\u00a0al., 2007). \n\t\nCaring for Families\t\n7\n", "family members (Frost, Green, Gance-Cleveland, Kersten, \n& Irby, 2010). Family-centered care can be implemented \nregardless of the clinical setting or environment.\nSiblings and extended family members should be invited \nto interact and provide care for the child (Figure 1-6). The \nfamily should be supported with respect to its constellation, \nability, presence (many care providers have to continue to \nwork and may be absent for periods of time), economic \nstatus, and family functioning, without care providers mak\u00ad\ning judgments based on these aspects. Child Life specialists \nshould be involved with the assessment of the family\u2019s needs \nand available to assist with medical play, education, and \nguidance for all family members. Reaching out beyond the \nclinical settings is also important to family-centered care, \nwith schools, primary providers and community resources \nbeing identified and engaged as necessary.\nIn a family-centered care model, the nursing staff will \nrecognize that a child-friendly environment is a crucial \ncomponent of pediatric care. Play areas, brightly colored \nwalls and decorations, and avenues for distraction and \ndevelopmental growth are all essential.\nFamily-Centered Care\nIn recent decades, health institutions across the United \nStates have begun to recognize the importance of \nfamily-centered care and adopt the principles of this model. \nBased on the premise that the family is a key constant in \nthe child\u2019s life, the family-centered care model suggests \nrecognizing that all family members are affected by the \ninjury, illness, hospitalization, or healthcare need that \nthe child is experiencing. Providing support based on \nencouragement, enhancement of strengths, competence, \nand collaboration provides the foundation for interactions \nand successful outcomes.\nThe principles of the family-centered care model \npromote a partnership approach in which the family and \nhealthcare team work together to identify the best way \nto provide care for the child (Kuo et\u00a0al., 2012). Issues are \nprioritized based on the family\u2019s identified critical issues, \nand the team provides support based on what the family \nidentifies as most important. For example, if the child has \na chronic illness and the family cares for the child, the \nfamily will know the details of what the child needs and \nhow to best respond to these needs. Family-centered care \nprovides a structure to support the strengths of the family \nthrough a families-as-partners approach, while providing \nfor the child\u2019s medical and nursing needs.\nAlthough different variations of a family-centered care \napproach exist, they all rely on five main principles (Kuo \net\u00a0al., 2012):\n\u2022\t Information sharing\n\u2022\t Respecting and honoring differences\n\u2022\t Partnership and collaboration\n\u2022\t Negotiation\n\u2022\t Care in context of family and community\nThese principles are exemplified by two key ideas: \nenabling and empowerment. Enabling a family and child \nmeans that the professional healthcare team provides op\u00ad\nportunities for the family to gain and show mastery of the \ncare required by the child. Learning required skills such \nas suctioning, catheterizing, changing dressings, provid\u00ad\ning enteric nutrition, and organizing needed supplies are \nexamples. The pediatric team should provide the time, sup\u00ad\nplies, support, and education that build the family\u2019s sense \nof enabling. Empowerment suggests that the family feels \ncompetent to provide care for their child as a result of the \nsupport, education, and trust built through interacting with \nthe team. For example, one healthcare institution success\u00ad\nfully incorporated family-centered care into its pediatric \nunit through an emphasis on hope, engaged care, and love, \nwith the family\u2019s skills and interactions being supported \nand strengthened; this model allowed for the development \nof a collaborative partnership between care providers and \nBEST PRACTICES\nP\nediatric healthcare team members should adhere to the \nfollowing guidelines when delivering family-centered care:\n\u2022\t The family is the constant in the child\u2019s life.\n\u2022\t The family is one unit and should be treated as such.\n\u2022\t The family caring for a child with a chronic illness \nknows what the child needs and should be encour\u00ad\naged to demonstrate the best-care practices with \nwhich they are familiar.\n\u2022\t The family should be assisted to develop or continue \nto grow in both empowerment (competence and \nconfidence) and enabling (provision of sound care).\n\u2022\t The family should be provided with education and \neducational materials; information sharing is a priority.\n\u2022\t The family and providers are collegial care team \nmembers and should be treated with dignity, respect, \nand collaboration.\n\u2022\t The family should be encouraged to take on \ndecision-making roles.\n\u2022\t The family should be provided support to live with nor\u00ad\nmalcy and should be given information about outside \nresources, community support networks, and education.\n\u2022\t Siblings and extended family members should be \nincluded in care and planning.\nData from American Hospital Association.

More recently, \nconcept-based nursing has gained great respect and in\u00ad\nterest as an alternative to traditional nursing education \nand learning. Concept-based learning uses a dynamic \napproach to the ever-growing body of scientific nursing \nknowledge; it focuses on key concepts that can be applied \nto various situations and settings.

Critical thinking, in general, is a problem-solving \nmeans of thinking through a complex situation and draw\u00ad\ning conclusions that will best help a child and their family. \nCritical thinking in pediatric nursing is used to separate \nwhat is known from what is unknown while helping a \nteam of concerned healthcare providers devise a plan to \nassist a child in need. According to Papathanasiou et\u00a0al. \n(2014), critical thinking is a method of problem solving \nthat combines creativity with a specific set of cognitive \nskills\u2014specifically, critical analysis (e.g., the Socratic \nmethod), inference, and concluding justification\u2014to assess \nand evaluate information. By using a critical thinking mode \nof problem solving, pediatric nurses can identify problems \nearly and devise systems and interventions to assist a child \nin need. Table 1-3 summarizes the components of the \nPapathanasiou et\u00a0al. critical thinking model.\nSometimes critical thinking is considered a program \noutcome. In Staib\u2019s (2003) interactive model of critical think\u00ad\ning, the basic structures of thought are what create sound \nthinking and effective problem solving. Staid describes \neight essential components of thinking that are needed \nin the development of a program with distinct outcomes:\n\u2022\t Raise questions.\n\u2022\t Generate a purpose.\n\u2022\t Use information.\n\u2022\t Utilize concepts.\n\u2022\t Make inferences.\n\u2022\t Make assumptions.\n\u2022\t Generate implications.\n\u2022\t Embody a point of view.\n\t\nConcept-Based Care in Pediatrics\t\n9\n", "TABLE 1-3\u2003\nComponents of Papathanasiou et\u00a0al.

Acta Informatica Medica, 22(4), 283\u2013286. \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nCritical Thinking for Safety\nCritical thinking can be applied to safety in pediatric nursing. \nFor example, if a pediatric nurse is caring for a child with compli\u00ad\ncated family dynamics, a diagnosis of severe cerebral palsy and \nfailure to thrive, and possible evidence of abuse and neglect, \nusing components of critical thinking can help to formulate a \nplan for safety.\n\u2022\t Recognize assumptions. Children with severe cerebral \npalsy may be considered vulnerable to child abuse be\u00ad\ncause they are dependent, often nonverbal, sometimes \ntechnology dependent, skills demanding, and seen as \n\u201cdifferent.\u201d Care providers may not be able to provide \nfor their complex needs. The failure to thrive may be as\u00ad\nsumed to be based on neglect, the most common form \nof child maltreatment.\n\u2022\t Evaluate arguments. Does evidence exist that the child \nis at risk for poor care? Does evidence exist that the \nchild has been neglected? Do the complications of \nthe family dynamics place the child at risk for neglect? \nAre the basic care needs of this child being met at \nhome?\n\u2022\t Draw conclusions. The child\u2019s safety is paramount. The \nphysical and emotional needs of the child must be \nmet. Supportive resources such as nutrition, warmth, \nrest, appropriate clothes, medicine and medical care, \nplay and distraction, and safe supervision must be \nsecured. If the family cannot provide for the child with \nsevere cerebral palsy and complex medical needs, \nthen reporting the evidence of child abuse/neglect is \nwarranted.\n10\t\nChapter 1\u2003 Introduction to Children\u2019s Health Care\n", "Clinical Judgment\nClinical judgment is a term that is sometimes considered \ninterchangeable with \u201cproblem solving,\u201d \u201cdecision mak\u00ad\ning,\u201d and \u201ccritical thinking.\u201d It comprises the analysis, \ninterpretation, and drawing of conclusions about a patient\u2019s \ncondition, including the patient\u2019s holistic needs, concerns, \nhealth problems, and areas of needed action or intervention \n(Tanner, 2006). Pediatric nurses must use sound clinical \njudgment to provide high-level holistic care. Nurses\u2019 clini\u00ad\ncal judgment is influenced by their experience, expertise, \nrelationships with patients and families, and working as \na team member. According to Tanner (2006), five con\u00ad\nclusions can be drawn about the use and application of \nclinical judgment:\n\u2022\t Clinical judgments are more strongly influenced by \nwhat nurses bring to the situation than by the data \n(objective) collected concerning the situation.\n\u2022\t Clinical judgments about patients are highly influ\u00ad\nenced by the situational context and the culture of \nthe nursing environment.\n\u2022\t Knowledge of both the patient and the patient\u2019s typ\u00ad\nical pattern of responses, complemented by engage\u00ad\nment with the patient and family, have the greatest \ninfluence on sound clinical judgment.\n\u2022\t Improved clinical reasoning and the development \nof clinical knowledge follow from reflection upon \none\u2019s practice.\n\u2022\t Nurses make clinical judgments based on a variety \nof single or combined reasoning patterns.\nTABLE 1-4\u2003\nSelected Professional Organizations That Support Pediatric Nursing\nSociety of Pediatric Nurses (www.pedsnurses.org)\nSigma Theta Tau International Nursing Honor Society (www.nursingsociety.org)\nAssociation for Vascular Access (www.avainfo.org)\nAssociation of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nurses (www.aphon.org)\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (www.aap.org)\nPediatric Nursing Certification Board (www.pncb.org)\nTranscultural Nursing Society (www.tcns.org)\nNational League for Nursing (www.nln.org)\nEmergency Nurses Association (www.ena.org)\nAssociation of Camp Nurses (www.acn.org)\nAmerican Nurses Association (www.nursingworld.org)\nNational Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (www.napnap.org) \nProfessional Pediatric Nursing Care\nPediatric nurses care for both the child and the family. \nNurses who care for children with complex health con\u00ad\nditions understand the need for professional care based \non concepts, theory, and skills specific to children while \napplying a knowledge base that focuses on the promotion \nof normal growth and development.\nMany professional organizations provide education, \nbest practices information, and collegial support for \npediatric nurses. The Society of Pediatric Nurses (SPN) \nis an internationally focused, U.S.-based organization \nthat provides a multitude of opportunities for mentor\u00ad\ning, education, research, and scholarly development. \nSPN publishes Journal of Pediatric Nursing, which pro\u00ad\nvides state-of-the-science research and best practices \ninformation on caring for children and families. Other \nprofessional nursing organizations have focus groups \nor specialty practice subgroups that provide support for \npediatric nurses.\nBecause most hospitalized patients are adults, pediatric \nnurses are fewer in number and often practice in isolation, \nsuch as in pediatric clinics or pediatric units, contributing \nto the need for collaboration among the profession as a \nwhole. It is imperative that these nurses become aware of \nnational initiatives, research endeavors, and best practices \nprojects to move the profession of pediatric nursing for\u00ad\nward.

During the span from approximately age 3 through \nadolescence, a child should have annual well-child check-\nups for health screening and education. Most anticipatory \nguidance is provided to parents or guardians in a clinic \nsetting during these wellness visits. Table 2-1 provides \ninformation on suggested well-child visits across the \ndevelopmental period.\nAnother common setting in which children\u2019s healthcare \nservices are provided is primary and secondary school clin\u00ad\nics, where nurses provide short-term care for children who \nbecome ill or injured during the school day, or management \nof symptoms or problems associated with chronic illness. \nRecreational settings such as camps, athletic programs, and \nbefore- or after-school programs may also include nursing \ncare as part of the service.\nBasic Competencies in Pediatric \nNursing\nRegardless of the setting in which a pediatric nurse prac\u00ad\ntices, basic care competencies (i.e., the skills and knowl\u00ad\nedge needed to provide care appropriately and effectively) \nare expected. Pediatric nursing utilizes skills and knowl\u00ad\nedge that differ from those employed in adult nursing care. \nChildren differ from adults in terms of their physiology \nand emotional development, and pediatric subpopulations \nhave unique developmental needs. Pediatric nurses must \nbe able to adapt their skills to care for children who range \nfrom neonate through adolescence (Figure 2-2).\nIntroduction\nHealth care for children is provided across many diverse \nsettings. The hospital setting that may be widely viewed as \na major focus of pediatric nursing care is, in reality, the site \nof only a small subset of caregiving. Hospital-based nursing \nfor children may be associated with many pediatric-specific \nskills and competencies, but nurses work in many other \nsettings to provide both health promotion and health \nrestoration to children. Moreover, few children experience \nhospitalization, and even fewer have chronic conditions, \ncongenital conditions, or acute illnesses that require multiple \nhospitalizations. In short, the majority of care provided to \nchildren across the age 0\u201318 years developmental period \noccurs in clinical settings outside the traditional hospital \nenvironment. Consequently, pediatric nurses need an \nawareness of how the context of care influences the goals \nand expectations of caregiving (Figure 2-1).\nWellness and Health Maintenance\nIn the vast majority of circumstances, pediatric nursing \ncare consists of routine care to maintain health, teach \nparents and patients about wellness-promoting choices, \nand support normal development. The setting in which \nsuch care is delivered, particularly in early childhood, is \ntypically the primary care setting. During early childhood, \nchildren need multiple visits to their healthcare providers \nfor assessment of their physical, mental, and emotional \ndevelopment; immunization; and education of parents \non meeting children\u2019s health and social needs.

The pediatric airway has a tri\u00ad\nangular shape, which renders children more suscep\u00ad\ntible to airway obstruction and compromise. A child\u2019s \ntongue is also disproportionally larger, further increas\u00ad\ning the risk of airway obstruction.\n2.\t Infants are obligate nose breathers for the first \n8\u201312 weeks of life.

Place young infants (younger than approxi\u00ad\nmately 1 year) experiencing pulmonary illnesses in a \nsniffing position so as to not occlude their airway.\n4.\t Young infants have poorly developed intercostal muscles. \nNurses should assess for respiratory distress and retrac\u00ad\ntions. When these muscles become fatigued, an infant \nmay experience respiratory compromise and distress or \nrespiratory failure and require resuscitation efforts. Report \nand act on all presentations of intercostal retractions.\n5.\t Children have less pulmonary tidal volume compared \nto adults, and may need oxygen when experiencing \nearly respiratory distress due to pulmonary obstruction, \ninflammation, or secretions.\n6.\t Children have an overall larger ratio of body surface to \nmass compared to adults. As a consequence, infants \ncan experience heat loss readily. They should always be \ndressed warmly, and young infants should wear hats \nto prevent heat loss when exposed to environmental \nelements.\n7.\t Children have less total circulating blood compared to \nadults. Any bleeding, especially occult (hidden) bleeds, \nshould be identified. Repeated phlebotomy can cause a \ndecrease in the young child\u2019s hemoglobin and hematocrit; \nonly laboratory microcontainers should be used.\n8.\t Children will compensate for dehydration, trauma with \nblood loss, and other insults to the cardiovascular system \nfor a period of time, but then their blood pressure will drop \nrapidly. By comparison, adults demonstrate a longer pe\u00ad\nriod of cardiovascular demise. Children compensate first, \nand then their overall clinical picture deteriorates rapidly.\n9.\t Children younger than 5 years have higher glucose \nneeds than adults and minimal storage of glycogen in \nthe liver, and should be offered frequent feedings or \nsnacks to maintain their blood sugar levels. Infants have \nvariability in gastric motility, gastric emptying, and \ngastric contents.\n10.\t Children have higher metabolic rates and, in general, \nneed more calories per kilogram of weight than adults \ndo. Always calculate a child\u2019s kilocalorie needs per weight. \n11.\t Children pose challenges in pain management, espe\u00ad\ncially in terms of assessment. Use age/development-\nappropriate subjective and objective pain scales in \nconjunction with physiologic measurements of pain \n(e.g., vital signs, oxygen saturation) to thoroughly \nassess pain in children, and treat pain appropriately.\n12.\t Young children are at risk for dehydration. It is impor\u00ad\ntant to use the pediatric fluid maintenance calculation \nto determine minimal daily fluid needs. Electrolyte \nblood values differ in the various age groups; narrow \nfluctuations in values can reflect dehydration and \nelectrolyte imbalances. Frequently, fluid boluses are \nrequired to reverse moderate to severe dehydration.\n13.\t An infant\u2019s skin is very thin and can easily absorb topical \nmedications, creams, and ointments. It is important to use \nonly those medications ordered and to apply a thin layer.\n(continues)\nBEST PRACTICES\nPediatric Nursing Competencies\nPediatric nurses must be able to demonstrate the following \ncompetencies:\n1.\t Gather essential and accurate information about the \nchild and family throughout each developmental \nstage (prematurity, newborn, early infancy, late infancy, \ntoddler, preschooler, early school age, later school age, \nand adolescence).\n2.\t Perform a physical assessment of a child throughout \nthe developmental stages, including assessment of \nrespiratory, neurosensory, cardiovascular, metabolic, \ngastrointestinal, genitourinary, immunologic, and \nmusculoskeletal status.

Communication within the multidisciplinary pediatric \nhealthcare team is imperative for safe and effective care \nof a child. Conducting a visual and physical assessment \nwith a complete set of vital signs, head circumference \n(for children younger than 2 years), and weight, and \nthen communicating areas of concern to the team rapidly \nand with clarity, can be lifesaving (see Unique for Kids: \nUse of Anthropometric Measurements, Laboratory Test\u00ad\ning, and Screening Across Settings) (Figure 2-3). Taking \nthe time to organize one\u2019s thinking before communicating \nconcerns or deviations in the findings can lead to greater \nclarity of the information shared. Indeed, rapid commu\u00ad\nnication using a thoughtful means of organization is now \na practice promoted throughout healthcare institutions.\n\t\nBasic Competencies in Pediatric Nursing\t\n19\n", "QUALITY AND SAFETY\nW\nhen a child presents to a pediatric healthcare team, re\u00ad\ngardless of the clinical setting, the following clinical signs \nand symptoms should be reported immediately to the team:\n\u2022\t Respiratory distress, shortness of breath, increased \nwork of breathing, and retractions\n\u2022\t Vital signs out of the expected value range\n\u2022\t Changes in perfusion such as delayed capillary refill \ntime, decreased diastolic blood pressure, and evi\u00ad\ndence of dehydration\n\u2022\t Changes in level of consciousness, including lethargy\n\u2022\t Decreased oxygen saturation\n\u2022\t Significant pain\n\u2022\t Evidence of actual or suspected child abuse\nFigure 2-4\u2002\n\u00a9 wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock\nFigure 2-3\u2002\n\u00a9 KrystynaTaran/iStock/Getty Images Plus/Getty\nEffective Communication Within \na\u00a0Healthcare Team\nAlthough the health science literature describes many \ncommunication techniques, those that have been validated \nmay be considered most effective. Two examples of com\u00ad\nmunication techniques that have been found to be effective \nare SBAR and CUS:\n\u2022\t SBAR: Situation, background, assessment, \nrecommendation\n\u2022\t CUS: \u201cI am concerned about.\u00a0.\u00a0.,\u201d \u201cI am uncomfort\u00ad\nable with.\u00a0.\u00a0.,\u201d \u201cI think we have a safety issue.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\nThe SBAR protocol is a relatively simple set of steps that \nhas been found to be effective for healthcare profession\u00ad\nals in numerous settings (e.g., Cornell, Gervis, Yates, & \nVardaman, 2014; Funk et\u00a0al., 2016; Lancaster, Westphal, & \nJambunathan, 2015). This protocol ensures the appropriate \ncommunication of key information and increases the ef\u00ad\nficiency of team interactions.\nThe CUS protocol is a means of encoding a level of \nconcern by selecting key phrases that staff must be trained \nto recognize as indicating that a red-flag issue exists. \nWhereas SBAR is a formal process indicating how infor\u00ad\nmation is to be routinely communicated, CUS is intended \nas a means of communicating a need for heightened \nawareness or increased prioritization of the information \nembedded in the \u201ctrigger\u201d words. Both protocols have \nbeen described as generally helpful in the literature; it \nbenefits a nurse to learn and practice them in nearly \nevery setting.\nHuddles\nA widely used method for intrateam communication is the \nmorning huddle. This method involves setting a predeter\u00ad\nmined time each morning to discuss the day\u2019s schedule and \nclarify patient needs (Figure 2-4). Although a variety of \nprocesses may be followed for huddles, several key points \nmake huddles effective:\n\u2022\t The format ensures that all interested parties are \npresent to exchange information in a regular, orga\u00ad\nnized fashion.\n\u2022\t Each patient\u2019s status and needs are reviewed \ndaily.\n\u2022\t The huddle can be targeted toward specific areas of \ncommunication concern that need support, rather \nthan reiterating communication that is already \neffective.\nHandoffs\nAn area of specific concern with respect to communication \nis the handoff of patients from one provider to another, \nincluding shift-to-shift reporting within a department, \n20\t\nChapter 2\u2003 Care Across Clinical Settings\n", "the knowledge and psychomotor skills required to be safe \nand competent in care.\nSeeking national certification in pediatric nursing \nand associated specialty areas is highly beneficial for the \npediatric nurse who seeks to demonstrate ongoing com\u00ad\npetency. Certification in pediatric nursing demonstrates \na commitment, regardless of the clinical setting in which \none practices, to a distinct body of knowledge that can be \ntested and recognized on a national basis. Box 2-1 lists \navailable pediatric nursing certifications.\nCompetencies According to Setting\nPediatric Nursing in Primary Care and Outpatient \nSettings\nMost health care provided to children across childhood \ntakes the form of wellness checks or minor illness care in \noutpatient settings such as clinics and physicians\u2019 offices. \nGeneral care pediatrician offices provide the largest amount \nof care, followed by pediatric specialty clinics such as those \nrun by pulmonologists, endocrinologists, and orthopedists. \ntransferring a child between units or departments within a \nfacility, and transferring a child from one facility to another. \nIn such situations, those providers who are assuming control \nof the child\u2019s care need to be appropriately informed of the \nspecific details of the child\u2019s condition in a clear, concise \nmanner. The importance of effective communication dur\u00ad\ning patient handoffs is paramount: Miscommunication or \nlack of communication during handoff has been identified \nas a precipitating factor in nearly one-third of all medical \nerrors (Starmer et\u00a0al., 2012).\nCommunication techniques that can be used to organize \nthe information shared during handoffs should include \nthree distinct phases (Riesenberg, 2012):\n1.\t Anticipation and preparation for the handoff prework, \nincluding preparing the patient and the family for \ntransitions and reviewing recent lab work, diagnos\u00ad\ntics, and outstanding orders.\n2.\t Actual handoff of communication given in an or\u00ad\nganized and thoughtful way.\n3.\t Transferring responsibility with an explicit acknowl\u00ad\nedgment of the transfer of care, including document\u00ad\ning the full name of the person receiving care of the \nchild and family.\nAn example of an effective handoff mnemonic is I-PASS \n(Starmer et\u00a0al., 2012), which identifies key points that must \nbe reported by the transferring provider to the recipient \nprovider to ensure adequate care:\nI = Illness severity\nP = Patient summary\nA = Action list\nS = Situation awareness and contingency planning\nS = Synthesis by receiver\nAn especially important aspect of the I-PASS mnemonic \nis the last S\u2014synthesis by the receiver. This stage offers \nan opportunity for the transferring provider to correct \nmisunderstandings about the information provided \n(Figure 2-5).\nCertification of Competency\nOrganizations such as the American Association of Col\u00ad\nleges of Nursing, the American Nurses Association, and \nthe Society for Pediatric Nurses provide lists of what are \nconsidered basic knowledge and skills competencies \nfor practicing pediatric nurses. Keeping current in the \never-changing field of pediatrics is important to maintain \nawareness of contemporary issues in children\u2019s health. \nMost healthcare institutions require pediatric nurses to \nparticipate in mandatory annual skills competency work\u00ad\nshops, a step that is intended to ensure that they maintain \nFigure 2-5\u2002\n\u00a9 DenisNata/Shutterstock\n\t\nCompetencies According to Setting\t\n21\n", "Accordingly, clinic settings require emergency preparedness \nequipment and procedures; Box 2-2 provides examples. \nMany children who require minor surgical procedures will \nreceive care at outpatient (ambulatory) surgical centers. \nSince many of the newest technologies reduce the risk of \nadverse reactions, many minor surgeries can be performed \nin one day with explicit discharge care instructions for the \nparent or guardian.\nBOX 2-1\u2002 Certifications for Pediatric Nurses Across Clinical Settings\n\u2022\t Certified Wound Care Nurse: CWCN (www.woundcare \nnurses.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Registered Nurse Infusion: CRNI (www.incc1.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Diabetes Educator: CDE (www.ncbde.org)\n\u2022\t Chemotherapy and Biotherapy Administration Certification \n(www.ons.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nurse: CPHON \n(www.aphon.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Pediatric Nurse Exam: CPN (www.pncb.org)\n\u2022\t Registered Nurse\u2013Board Certified (Pediatric): RN-BC \n(www.nursecredentialing.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Pediatric Emergency Nurse: CPEN (www.pncb\n.org)\n\u2022\t International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant: IBCLC \n(www.iblce.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Post Anesthesia Nurse: CPAN (www.cpancapa\n.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Clinical Research Coordinator: CCRC \n(www.acrpnet.org/MainMenuCategory/Certification)\n\u2022\t Certified Nurse Educator: CNE (www.nln.org)\n\u2022\t Certified Pediatric Critical Care Nurse: P-CCRN (www.aacn\n.org)\nNurses working in primary care and outpatient settings \nneed to perform appropriate physical and developmental \nassessments of the child as well as assess whether the child\u2019s \nand family\u2019s psychosocial, educational, spiritual, and emo\u00ad\ntional needs are being met. Care must be evidence based and \ncomply with both established standards of ethical practice \nand Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n(HIPAA) regulations. Sensitivity to cultural identity and \nadvocacy for family self-determination are also important \naspects of practice.\nIn the outpatient setting, nurses must be prepared to \nparticipate in patient care procedures and respond to \nunexpected changes in patient status, including initiating \nand participating in a code. Because complete cardiopul\u00ad\nmonary arrests are uncommon in children, practicing \npediatric emergency skills with a team approach can be \nlifesaving.\nSchool Nursing\nSchool nursing involves consultation and hands-on care \nfor children in academic settings. The roles of the school \nnurse are to provide safety for all and to oversee the school \ndistrict\u2019s health programs and policies, such as medica\u00ad\ntion administration at school. Providing health educa\u00ad\ntion, health screenings, and serving as a liaison between \nthe family, community, and school personnel are critical \naspects of the school nurse\u2019s services. Given the close ties \nbetween academic performance and success and a child\u2019s \nhealth, the school nurse provides support, education, and \nprograms to increase the health of the children within the \nacademic setting.\nAccording to the National Association of School Nurses \n(2016), there are five primary areas of specialized practice \nin the school nursing setting:\n\u2022\t Leadership in promoting health and safety, includ\u00ad\ning promoting a healthy academic and community \nenvironment\n\u2022\t Expertise in facilitating growth and development, \nespecially for those students with special needs\n\u2022\t Interventions for potential and actual healthcare \nproblems and needs\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\u2002\nPreventing Injuries in Clinic Settings\nWhen children and their families are receiving care in \noutpatient or ambulatory care settings, providers should \nperform environmental assessments of these settings for \nsafety issues:\n\u2022\t Assessment of safety concerns in the waiting room \narea, including the provision of safe toys, small chairs \nand tables for young children, and parental or guard\u00ad\nian supervision while waiting to be seen.\n\u2022\t Infection control measures if a child with a communi\u00ad\ncable disease or infection is waiting to be seen. \nProvide masks and a separate area for waiting, or \ntriage patients rapidly to remove an infectious child \nfrom others in the waiting area.\n\u2022\t Procedures and protocols for cleaning equipment \nbetween each child visit.\n\u2022\t Presence of a monitor and up-to-date crash cart with \na color-coded emergency response tape.\n\u2022\t Protocols and procedures to ensure safety within an \nexamination room, including locked drawers and \ncabinets and provisions to prevent falls from examina\u00ad\ntion tables.\n22\t\nChapter 2\u2003 Care Across Clinical Settings\n", "BOX 2-2\u2003\n\u0007Preparation for Emergencies: Equipment Required in All Clinical Settings\n\u2022\t Crash carts\n\u2022\t Printed algorithms to respond to various arrhythmias (code \nblue algorithms)\n\u2022\t Tanks of oxygen, regulators, and oxygen delivery systems\n\u2022\t Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) poster explaining this \nprocedure for infants, children, adolescents, and adults\n\u2022\t Choking poster including guidelines to remove a foreign \nbody\n\u2022\t Means to call 911 or another appropriate emergency re\u00ad\nsponse telephone number\n\u2022\t Emergency number for the American Association of Poison \nControl Centers (800-222-1222)\n\u2022\t Rapid Response Team\u2019s contact number\n\u2022\t Color-coded length-based emergency response tapes\n\u2022\t Defibrillator\nVerify scene safety.\nVictim is unresponsive.\nShout for nearby help.\nFirst rescuer remains with victim.\nSecond rescuer activates emergency\nresponse system and retrieves AED\nand emergency equipment.\nCPR\nFirst rescuer begins CPR with\n30:2 ratio (compressions to breaths).\nWhen second rescuer returns, use\n15:2 ratio (compressions to breaths).\nUse AED as soon as it is available.\nGive 1 shock.

Providing campers with care\u00ad\nful prescreening, directing camp counselors on ways to \nidentify when nursing care is needed, using the nursing \nprocess, communicating effectively, and assessing for \ncamp activities that may have increased injury risks are all \npart of the standards of practice. The camp nurse must be \nprepared to care for children with differing backgrounds, \nsocioeconomic status, cultures, ethnicities, and ages. The \ncamp nurse job may last for only a few days or a few weeks, \nor the camp nurse may be hired for year-round duties.\nWhile the scope of practice for a camp nurse and for a \nschool nurse has some similarities, the settings and venues in \nwhich these nurses work have some fundamental differences. \nConcerns such as drowning, hypothermia, and broken bones \nare more likely in an outdoor camp setting than in a school \nor day camp setting, calling for a higher level of emergency \nmedicine skills and competencies. Other environmental \ninjuries, such as sunburn, bee stings, and dehydration, will \nalso be more common in the camp setting, as will illnesses \nsuch as urinary tract or respiratory infections.\nPediatric Nursing in Acute Care Environments\nChildren who receive care in an acute care environment \ntypically have complex healthcare needs that require ex\u00ad\npanded medical treatments and nursing care beyond what \ncan be offered in a clinic or ambulatory setting. Acute care \npediatric nursing is team oriented, as the nurse facilitates \nthe smooth implementation of care by multiple providers \nand team members. Often, the nurse coordinates visits \nand care provided by respiratory therapists, occupational \ntherapists, physical therapists, nutritionists, play therapy/\nChild Life specialists, specialty nurses (e.g., for wound \ncare), social workers, and members of the medical team. \nThe acute care pediatric nurse implements family-centered \ncare principles to ensure a satisfying and effective hospi\u00ad\ntalization for children, with providers\u2019 interactions being \nbased on collegiality and respect. Families whose child is \nhospitalized may be experiencing stress and, therefore, \nneed a team approach to reduce their anxiety and worries.\nA typical assignment for an acute care nurse may include \nas many as four pediatric patients, although this workload \nmay vary by institution and state regulations. The environ\u00ad\nment is demanding, fast-paced, and challenging. Children \nwho are hospitalized in acute care settings have either an \nacute condition, such as appendicitis or bronchiolitis, or an \nacute episode of a chronic illness, such as asthma-related \npneumonia. The pediatric acute care nurse provides nursing \ncare, medical treatments, care coordination, communica\u00ad\ntion with family, and frequent assessments while the child\u2019s \ncondition remains guarded.

They \nare also expected to observe and report signs of significant \nhealth or safety concerns, such as abuse or malnutrition.\nCamp Nursing\nCamp nursing provides health support for children who \nattend day or overnight camps. Performed in a variety of \nsettings, camp nursing can include care for healthy children \nor care for children with specific conditions. Specialty care \ncamps include those for children with cancer, sickle cell \ndisease, asthma, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and many other \nmedical conditions (Figure 2-6). Children\u2019s camps may \nhave members of the medical team on location, or the \ncamp nurse may communicate directly with a physician \nwhen concerns arise.\nThe camp nurse is in charge of administering medica\u00ad\ntions to children and safely storing medications, supplies, \nand equipment. Some camps provide an infirmary, while \nothers may have a camp nurse office. Being independent \nand organized are important attributes for any camp nurse. \nOften the camp has set policies and procedures for the nurse \nto assess for and treat mild medical conditions such as \nsunburns, insect bites, and minor injuries, all while keeping \ncareful documentation of the care delivered to the children.\nFigure 2-6\u2002\n\u00a9 Diego Cervo/Shutterstock\n24\t\nChapter 2\u2003 Care Across Clinical Settings\n", "ages and developmental stages from newborn through \nadolescence, and have to experience a fast-paced process \nof rapid care\u2014diagnosis through treatment. According \nto Majumdar (2014), pediatric emergency room nursing \nrequires the nurses to demonstrate the following abilities:\n\u2022\t Handle multifaceted cases of illness, injury, or \ntrauma calmly while balancing the feeling of ur\u00ad\ngency related to the situation for the family\n\u2022\t Rapidly stabilize the child\u2019s clinical presentation\n\u2022\t Quickly implement diagnostic and treatment \nsolutions\n\u2022\t Work within a fast-paced environment\n\u2022\t Administer correct nursing interventions and accu\u00ad\nrate medications, while reducing errors\n\u2022\t Master new skills and seek further knowledge/\ncertification\n\u2022\t Be caring, patient, and supportive, and reduce \nstressors and anxiety for the patient and family\n\u2022\t Not feel heartbreak and despair when a child does \nnot make it through a life-threatening illness, \ninjury, or trauma\nleave the hospital, extensive discharge teaching is often \nrequired for families and may help prevent readmissions \nfor complications. After a thorough verbal explanation, \nthe nurse should provide written discharge instructions to \nthe family using simple terms and after securing assistance \nfrom an interpreter as needed.\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nPlay in All Settings\nPlay, also called \u201cthe work of a child\u201d by Italian physician \nMaria Montessori, should be provided across all clinical \nsettings. Opportunities for distraction with coloring, puzzles, \nblocks, games, and other developmentally appropriate and \nsafe play items should be provided for the child and his \nor her siblings. Use the knowledge and skills of Child Life \nspecialists in preparing play opportunities in the various care \nsettings.\nPediatric Nursing in Emergency Departments\nPediatric emergency department nursing is considered one \nof the most challenging areas of nursing care. Most of the \npatient care interactions stem from incidents involving \ninjury or trauma; many cases present as life-threatening \nsituations for the child. Immediate issues need to be \nassessed, diagnosed, and treated or triaged, even if the \nchild presents with an illness versus an injury, accident, \nor trauma (Figure 2-7). Specialty training is required for \npediatric emergency department nurses, including train\u00ad\ning in teamwork with air medical teams, ground medical \nteams, and other pediatric medical specialists.\nChildren who present to the emergency department \nhave unique needs.

Because a child\u2019s clinical picture can \nchange rapidly when the child is critically ill, nurses working \nin pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or neonatal intensive \ncare unit (NICU) environments must have the skills to rapidly \nassess and act on emergencies and severe conditions. Some \nhealthcare organizations have adult intensive care unit \n(ICU) nurses who are cross-trained for pediatric intensive \ncare and provide for children\u2019s needs within an adult ICU \nsetting. Other, larger hospitals\u2014mostly in urban environ\u00ad\nments\u2014provide PICU beds and nurses who have specialty \ntraining and certification in caring for very ill children. An \nexample of a specialty certification for PICU nurses is the \nCritical Care Registered Nurse (CCRN) certificate offered \nby the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.\nPediatric Nursing in Home Care Settings\nHome care nurses provide assistance at home to maintain \nthe continuum of care. Many provide care to pediatric \npatients who are discharged from the hospital with exten\u00ad\nsive medical needs. Parenteral nutrition, continuation of \nantibiotics, respiratory assessment, support, education, and \nfollow-up can all be provided in the home setting. Infants \nwith special needs such as phototherapy for hyperbilirubi\u00ad\nnemia, feeding tube care, tracheostomies, and mechanical \nventilation can now transition from a hospital setting to \nhome safely, with the assistance and expertise of a home \nhealth nurse.

Each year, approximately 9 million children seek \ncare in U.S. emergency departments for injuries; 225,000 \nchildren require hospitalization for injuries; and 9000 \nchildren die (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n[CDC], 2015). Both governmental bodies and professional \norganizations have published guidelines to conceptualize \nand anticipate safety concerns for children.\nQSEN Competencies\nOne of the most recently introduced national initiatives \nfor nurses on safety across the lifespan is Quality and \nSafety Education for Nurses (QSEN). The QSEN project \nwas launched in 2005 to address some of the challenges \nencountered when trying to prepare nurses for professional \npractice (Cronenwett et al., 2007; Dolansky & Moore, 2013; \nSherwood & Zomorodi, 2014). The project, which is funded \nby the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, focuses on the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to consistently \nand continuously improve the practice of professional \nnursing. Multidisciplinary teams worked collaboratively \nto create guidelines for six competencies: patient-centered \ncare, evidence-based practice (best practice based on the \nintegration of clinical expertise, scientific evidence, and the \npatient\u2019s and family\u2019s\u00a0perspectives), quality improvement, \nteamwork and collaboration, informatics (the \u00adapplication \nof information and computer science to health care), \nand safety. The founders partnered with organizations \nthat represent current practice and proposed a set of \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes required for safe nursing \neducation and practice. Table 3-1 summarizes the main \nsafety competencies within this initiative.\nIntroduction\nThe concept of safety within pediatrics is a key component \nof holistic (i.e., caring for the whole person, including not \nonly his or her medical condition, but also any mental, \nsocial, and environment concerns) and comprehensive \npediatric nursing care. Young children are inherently \nunsafe and require more than just supervision; that is, \nthey require safe environments in which to play, grow, \ndevelop, and thrive. They require responsible adults to \nprovide anticipated safety measures at home and in day\u00ad\ncare, school, and playground settings, and they require \nan emerging sense of safety within that manifests as safe \ndecisions as they mature. Neither infants nor young toddlers \ncan be expected to understand what is \u201csafe\u201d and what is \n\u201cunsafe,\u201d but by a child\u2019s third birthday, there should be \na basic understanding that certain behaviors will put the \nchild in harm\u2019s way.\nMany national organizations have developed safety \nguidelines for children of all ages. Pediatric nurses are in the \nunique position of being able to discuss safety regardless of \nthe clinical setting in which they see a patient. The Society \nof Pediatric Nurses, American Academy of Pediatrics, and \nAssociation of Critical Care Nurses all promote safety as a \nhigh priority. Being an excellent safety role model is one of \nthe most important responsibilities of the pediatric nurse, \nso as to teach families, caregivers, teachers, and children \nwhat is and is not safe, and how to plan for safety (advice \ngiven as part of anticipatory guidance). The pediatric nurse \nis instrumental in demonstrating safe care for children all \nacross the developmental period, including those with \nspecial needs (i.e., disabilities in medical, psychological, \nor mental functioning that affect a child\u2019s development), \nsuch as developmentally disabled or medically fragile \nchildren. This chapter discusses pediatric safety concerns \nand provides guidance on how to plan ahead for safe \nenvironments for children.\nNational Safety Initiatives\nEvery year, a staggering number of children experience \nsignificant unintentional injuries. Children are exposed \nto a large number of risks and hazards while they grow, \nlearn, and explore their environments (Figure 3-1).

Given the vast amount of knowledge that \na pediatric nurse must have to function with competency \nand safety, nurses can feel overloaded with information. \nThe application of concept-based learning\u2014a dynamic \napproach to the ever-growing body of scientific nursing \nknowledge that focuses on learning key concepts that can \nbe applied to various situations and settings\u2014promotes \nbuilding a mental bridge between large quantities of factual \nknowledge and conceptual understanding. These bridges \nallow one to rely less on facts and more on organizing \nconcepts that create mental links. Instead of memorizing \nfacts and trying to retrieve them, the nurse uses concepts \nto quickly link and integrate information within patient \nscenarios to provide \u201cthe big picture.\u201d Safety as a concept \nis widely used to promote a cascade of thinking about \nidentifying harm, reducing errors, and promoting safety. \nThinking conceptually about safety allows the nurse to \nreadily transfer existing knowledge to an actual clinical \nsituation (Figure 3-2).\nSafety, as a concept, reflects the many needs of a \nperson. By studying exemplars of clinical situations and \nthinking through the components of safety present in \nthose scenarios, the nurse can improve his or her rapid \napplication of integrated safety knowledge. For instance, \nif a nurse encounters a child with developmental delay \nwho has a new postoperative incisional wound, cannot \nprovide basic care for herself, and requires many treat\u00ad\nments and medications, the nurse can use the concept \nof safety to think about all of the safety concerns that \nmight arise for the child. These concerns include the \nFigure 3-2\u2002\n\u00a9 Tetra Images/Shutterstock\nfollowing questions: What is the best way to prevent the \nchild from touching the wound or pulling out sutures \nin light of her developmental delay? How can the child\u2019s \ncaretakers best avoid medication errors or interactions in \nthe medications used for her postsurgical therapy\u2014and \nwhat are the potential risks of such mistakes? How can \nthe nurse ensure that the child\u2019s pain is adequately treated \nin light of her special needs? How can these concerns be \naddressed both in the clinical setting and in the home \nafter the child is discharged? Using safety as a concept \nin care should trigger a cascade of potential and actual \nconcerns for the child. When such a conceptual lens is \nnot used, the nurse must rely on memorization and su\u00ad\nperficial thinking and is unlikely to develop the deeper \nunderstanding that accompanies integrated thinking \n(Miller, 2012).\n\t\nNational Safety Initiatives\t\n33\n", "Injury prevention and safety education for families based \non the child\u2019s specific developmental stage is a nursing \nimperative. Such education should also incorporate the \nspecial needs of children with intellectual or physical dis\u00ad\nabilities. Table 3-2 lists injury prevention topics based on \ndevelopmental stage that should be discussed with families.\nIdentifying and Addressing Safety \nIssues in the Community\nA child\u2019s environment can be a source of safety concerns. \nIndustrialized areas contain hazards in the air, water, and \nsoil. Urban households in high-traffic zones may be exposed \nto automobile-related hazards due to both increased risk \nof pedestrian accidents and poor air quality. The pediatric \nnurse must assess a family\u2019s concerns about the environ\u00ad\nment in which the child lives (Figure 3-3). Areas to assess \ninclude the following:\n\u2022\t Water contamination. Water contamination is a \nglobal concern for children. In the United States, \ncontaminated well water is a threat monitored by \nthe National Institute of Environmental Health \n(Mishamandani, 2015). Arsenic-, lead-, and \nmercury-contaminated water can affect a child\u2019s \ncognitive development and behavior. Dirty and \ncontaminated water is considered the planet\u2019s big\u00ad\ngest health threat to children (National Resources \nDefense Council, 2015).\n\u2022\t Lead poisoning. Children can be exposed to lead \nthrough water, food, air, deteriorating paint, dust, \nand contaminated soil. Although use of lead is now \nbanned in both gasoline and paint products, lead \npoisoning remains a serious safety concern owing \nto lead\u2019s persistent presence in the soil, old paint, \nindustrial emissions, and air. Health effects of lead \nexposure may include delays in mental and physical \ndevelopment, increased behavioral problems, and \nshort attention span. Younger children are more \nsensitive to the damage of lead exposure as their \nbones grow and tissues are more susceptible.\n\u2022\t Air quality. According the U.S. Environmental Pro\u00ad\ntection Agency (2017), millions of children live in \nareas where air quality poses potential and actual \nserious threats to their health with low-income \nfamilies and communities of color being at high \nrisk. Air pollution is linked to development of \nbronchitis and asthma, with these conditions being \nespecially prevalent in urban areas with heavy traf\u00ad\nfic (Milligan, Matsui, & Sharma, 2016). Asbestos\u2014a \nmineral fiber used in building construction materi\u00ad\nals, insulation, and fire-retardants\u2014has detrimental \nhealth effects as well. Second-hand smoke poses \nserious health risks for children in both the short \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nConceptual Thinking: Pediatric Safety\n\u2022\t Definition of the concept: The minimization of harm \nto both patients and providers through safe individual \npractice and safe effective systems.\n\u2022\t Prevalence and populations at risk: Pediatric patients \nfrom birth to adolescence.\n\u2022\t Personal risk factors: Identifying personal aspects that \nmay increase error or harm.\n\u2022\t Mechanism and consequences: Outcomes of unsafe \npractice or unsafe environments/systems.\n\u2022\t Clinical manifestations: Medical and medication \nerrors, bodily injury, acts of omission and commission.\n\u2022\t Clinical management: Application of safety models, \npractices, and protocols with continuous quality \nimprovement processes to evaluate best practices.\n\u2022\t Interrelated concepts: Development, ethics, account\u00ad\nability, advocacy, effective communication, and pro\u00ad\nfessional behavior.\n\u2022\t Concept exemplars: The study of clinical cases that \n\u00adilluminate the components of safety (i.e., a clinical case \nof child abuse and severe neglect of a young child \nwho relies on others to provide all aspects of nutrition, \nelimination, warmth, hygiene and safety) (Miller, 2012).\nAnother safety issue present in contemporary pediatric \nnursing is the identification of neglect. Children can suffer \nsafety issues associated with intentional or unintentional \nneglect of their basic needs. According to Mennen, Kim, \nSang, and Trickett (2010), child neglect is most prominent \nin families who are considered child welfare clients. Ne\u00ad\nglect for these high-risk families was found to be 71.0% \nwith 95% of the cases associated with other forms of child \nmaltreatment. Pediatric nurses must associate cases of \nchild neglect with other forms of safety issues and assess \nfor other forms of child abuse.\nModel of Thinking: Basics of Safety During Specific \nDevelopmental Stages\nChildren between 1 and 4 years of age and adolescents \nage 15 and older have the highest rates of accidental injuries \nin the United States. According to the CDC (2016), boys \nare twice as likely as girls to die from accidents associated \nwith unintentional injuries. The younger the child, the \ngreater the chance the injury will be related to transpor\u00ad\ntation (pedestrian, motor vehicle, or bicycles) or related \nto drowning or burns. Infants and toddlers are at greater \nrisk for aspiration, choking, or poisoning deaths.

Forty-eight percent of children live in \nlow-income families.\nClinicians should be aware of and screen for the many \nhealth and safety issues related to poverty (Chung et\u00a0al., \n2016). Families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds \nmay have safety issues associated with their residence in \nlower-income neighborhoods, exposure to crime, and \nrisk of substance abuse (Consumer Federation of America \n[CFA], 2013). Lower-income homes may lack supervision, \nas not all working parents can afford complete childcare \ncoverage. Children from lower-income households also \nhave more chronic illnesses such as asthma (Clark et\u00a0al., \n2015), reduced access to routine preventive health care \n(Center for Poverty Research, 2014), and greater risk of \nunintentional injuries generally as well as specifically from \npedestrian, fire, burn, drowning, and fall injuries than do \nother children (CFA, 2013). Poverty exacerbates concerns \nsuch as food insecurity and exposure to environmental \nhazards such as lead paint, which may affect child develop\u00ad\nment (Chung et\u00a0al., 2016).\nThe pediatric nurse should be aware of the various resources \navailable within the community and refer families in need to \nspecific community organizations that can provide needed \nassistance. These resources may include low-cost childcare \nservices or early childhood education programs such as Head \nStart, public health clinics, low-cost immunization clinics, \ncommunity-based safety fairs, food banks, and community \nkitchens where free or low-cost meals can be secured.\nand long terms; notably, it is directly linked to de\u00ad\nvelopment of ear infections, bronchitis, asthma, and \nsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Treyster & \nGitterman, 2011).\n\u2022\t Sun exposure. Most lifetime sun exposure occurs in \nthe first 18 years of life. Children must be protected \nfrom the harmful consequences of lengthy sun ex\u00ad\nposure and sunburns, as these events are directly \nlinked to development of skin cancer, premature \naging, inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva \nof the eye, accelerated cataract development, and \neffectiveness of the immune system (World Health \nOrganization, 2001).\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nWell Water Contamination and Intelligence\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that \nchildren who are exposed to drinking water containing \n\u00adlevels of arsenic greater than 5 \u00b5g/L experience a reduction \nof 5\u20136 points in most aspects of measured intelligence. \nArsenic, which is naturally found in the groundwater in \ncertain geographic areas, can have serious health con\u00ad\nsequences for children, including increasing their risks of \n\u00adneurodevelopmental disruption, diabetes, and cardiovas\u00ad\ncular disease (Wasserman et\u00a0al., 2014).\n RESEARCH EVIDENCE\nC\nhildren who have been diagnosed with attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at a much greater risk of \ninjury than children without ADHD, as they are distracted quite \neasily and experience more motor vehicle-versus-pedestrian \naccidents. Research has shown that although they may follow \ncurbside behaviors, children with ADHD are at a higher risk \ndue to their failure to process safety factors while crossing \nstreets and are especially prone to choosing small traffic gaps \nwhile crossing (Nikolas et\u00a0al., 2016). \nSafety at Home\nChildren live in a variety of settings\u2014rural, farm, urban, \nand suburban. Socioeconomic factors play a large role \nin determining the safety of the environment in which a \nchild lives. Unsafe neighborhoods where crime, drug traf\u00ad\nficking, and unemployment levels are high create greater \nsafety concerns for children. According to the National \nOne major concern for families who cannot afford \nafter-school care is \u201clatchkey\u201d children, referring to children \nwho are not supervised by a responsible adult after school. \nThe percentages of latchkey children have been reported as \n2% of 8-year-olds, 4% of 9-year-olds, 6% of 10-year-olds, \n11% of 11-year-olds, and 14% of 12-year-olds (Bureau of \nFigure 3-3\u2002\n\u00a9 Amble Design/Shutterstock\n36\t\nChapter 3\u2003 Essential Safety Models\n", "\u2022\t Ask a trustworthy neighbor or friend to be a \nbackup.\n\u2022\t Reinforce self-protection by locking windows and \ndoors.\n\u2022\t Keep keys handy but out of sight (do not wear \nhouse keys around neck).\n\u2022\t Provide and support after-school activities.\n\u2022\t Set clear rules as to what is expected regarding \nfriends, food preparation, screen time, and \nhomework.\n\u2022\t Set controls for media, TV, and computers.\nCreating a safe home environment for children is \nconsidered paramount, though the specific risks differ \nto some extent for boys and girls. Girls typically experi\u00ad\nence injuries within the house (burns, falls, and bodily \ninjury), whereas boys experience injuries outside or in \ngarage or storage areas (burns, suffocation, drowning, \nand bodily injury).

Nurses should keep a list of such resources available \nfor guiding parents.\nTalking to Parents About Car Safety\n\u2022\t Children should not be left alone in a car if the keys \nare in the ignition.\n\u2022\t Children younger than age 7 should never be left in a \ncar without a person who is at least 12 years old.\n\u2022\t Drivers must be careful to \u201clook before they lock,\u201d as \nheatstroke from leaving a quiet or sleeping child in a \nlocked car with the windows up can be fatal.\n\u2022\t Children need to be taught about blind zones \nbecause of the risk of \u201cfrontovers\u201d and \u201cbackovers\u201d; \ndiscuss the blind zones of a car.\nParents must know how to properly and safely install a \ncar seat. Double-checking that the car seat or booster seat \nis belted into the car, and not just the child into the car seat, \ncan save lives. \nFAMILY EDUCATION\u2002 (continued)\nSafety at Daycare Centers and Schools\nDaycare programs, preschools, and schools should all be \na safe place for children to play, learn, and thrive. Each \nsetting, whether private or public, should have safety pro\u00ad\ncedures that are written down and periodically reviewed. \nNurses can be instrumental in reviewing facilities, play\u00ad\ngrounds, procedures, sports equipment, and safety devices \nfor safety deficiencies. Playgrounds should have shade, \nsoft padding under climbing structures, safety fences to \nprevent wandering or intruders, and supervision between \nclasses and during breaks and recesses. Policies should \ninclude safety procedures for when children are departing \nthe facility, whether accompanied by a parent, riding on \na school bus, or walking or biking home by themselves. \nPolicies should also cover caring for an injured child \nand protocols for administering first aid; at least some \npersonnel supervising children should have specific first \naid and CPR training. Emergency phone numbers for fire, \npoison control, and 911 calls for ambulance and police \nshould be posted in all rooms of all buildings. Policies \nagainst bullying, violence, drugs, smoking, and alcohol \nshould be enforced.\nSafety at Play\nChildren need guidance and supervision while at play. \nNurses, in turn, should provide support and anticipatory \nguidance to families concerning safe play. Each develop\u00ad\nmental stage is associated with its own set of fine and gross \nmotor milestones, and play activities can promote the \nachievement of those milestones. Promoting safety during \nplay includes being aware of the potential injuries or ac\u00ad\ncidents that can occur, and providing rules and structure \nto prevent them. The following list outlines concerns that \nshould be anticipated during play:\n\u2022\t Children must consistently wear protective gear \nand helmets (e.g., during skateboarding, biking, \nsnow sports, contact sports, and extreme sports).\n\u2022\t Supervision must be provided to prevent deviations \nfrom sports rules (e.g., young children swimming \nwithout life vests or safety floatation devices).\n\u2022\t Climbing structures should be free of splinters, \nloose screws, or nails, and should have padding or \nsoft material underneath for protection during falls.\n\u2022\t Children should not be allowed to play on equip\u00ad\nment, bikes, or other devices not made for their \nage or developmental level (e.g., toddlers on \nskateboards).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nPreventing Injuries During Sports Activities: \nAnticipatory Guidance for Parents\n\u2022\t Role-model safety by always wearing seat belts, \nsports safety gear, and helmets.\n\u2022\t Insist on children of all ages wearing safety gear \nappropriate to the sport.\n\u2022\t Check for proper fitting; as children grow, they will \nneed larger sizes.\n\u2022\t Provide mouth gear and safety devices for protecting \nteeth.\nSafety in Clinical Settings\nHospitals\nHospitals are inherently unsafe places for children. Hospi\u00ad\ntal environments are often fast-paced, chaotic, filled with \nacutely or critically ill patients, busy with a host of healthcare \nprofessionals, and populated with complicated security \nmeasures. It is the pediatric nurse\u2019s priority to provide a \nsafe environment to hospitalized children\u2014and doing so \neffectively takes concerted effort (Figure 3-5). Environ\u00ad\nmental sweeps for safety concerns need to be conducted \non every shift, and prompt reporting of unsafe conditions, \n\t\nSafety in Clinical Settings\t\n39\n", "Figure 3-5\u2002\n\u00a9 PhotoAlto/Laurence Mouton/PhotoAlto Agency RF Collections/Getty\nTABLE 3-4\u2003\nChecklist for Keeping Children Safe in the Hospital\n\u203a\u203a\nEnsure young children have an alert system such as a \nbracelet or anklet that emits an alarm when the child leaves \nthe premises or comes close to stairwells and elevators; \ncheck frequently that the device is intact and operational.\n\u203a\u203a\nCover all electrical outlets and minimize the presence of \nelectrical equipment.\n\u203a\u203a\nNever leave unsafe items at the bedside or crib, including \nscissors, medications, hemostats, needles, or sharps of \nany form.\n\u203a\u203a\nDouble-check that crib rails are clicked into place and \nside rails are up.\n\u203a\u203a\nSelect beds that are safe for the child\u2019s age, \ndevelopmental stage, and size (e.g., high-top covered \ncribs for young children who stand).\n\u203a\u203a\nDo not allow parents to sleep in hospital beds with \ntheir infant.\n\u203a\u203a\nAssess infants and toddlers for strangulation injuries \nrelated to wires, tubes, and monitoring equipment. \nbroken equipment, or safety breaches is required. It is \neveryone\u2019s responsibility to prioritize safety for children \nin the hospital. Young children are particularly vulnerable \nto adverse effects as they explore their environment and \ntest limits (Table 3-4).\nFour major issues have been identified that put hos\u00ad\npitalized children at greater safety risks (Lacey, Smith, & \nCox, 2008):\n\u2022\t A child\u2019s fluid developmental status, as new mile\u00ad\nstones are implemented and boundaries are tested\n\u2022\t The dependency level inherent to children, espe\u00ad\ncially the nonverbal status of young children\n\u2022\t An acute (rather than chronic) episode, which leads \nto a higher level of required care\n\u2022\t Poverty, racial, and ethnic disparities, which place \nchildren at greater risk for poor outcomes\nOther concerns inherent to hospitalization of children \ninclude medical errors, medication errors, communica\u00ad\ntion errors, falls, injuries, abductions, and poor outcomes \ndirectly linked to hospital staffing.\nRates of Medical and Medication Errors in Pediatric Care\nMedical errors are responsible for more deaths among adults \nand children alike than motor vehicle accidents, according \nto Bleich\u2019s (2005) report from the Commonwealth Fund. \nWhile the majority of medication errors occur in adults\u2014as \nmany as 14 errors per 100 doses\u2014children experience from \napproximately 2.3 to 6 adverse drug events per 100 hospital \nadmissions (Sharek & Classen, 2006). Pediatric medication \ndoses must be calculated using a weight-based measurement \n(such as milligrams per kilogram or milligrams per body sur\u00ad\nface area) and double-checked for safety. Due to the need to \ncalculate doses individually for children, pediatric patients are \nup to three times more likely to experience \u201cnear-miss\u201d errors \n(Kaufmann, Laschat, & Wappler, 2012; Kaushal et\u00a0al., 2001).\nSome pediatric institutions require that all medications \nadministered to children be subjected to double-checking \nby nursing staff members against documentation and \nelectronic/written signatures (Figure 3-6). Examples of \nmedications/infusions for which pediatric registered nurses \nmay be expected to double-check the rights of medication \nadministration (right patient, drug, dose, time, and route) \ninclude the following therapies:\n\u2022\t Cardiac medications such as antihypertensives and \nantiarrhythmics (digoxin)\n\u2022\t Blood products\n\u2022\t Insulins and hypoglycemics\n\u2022\t Total parenteral nutrition and intralipids\n\u2022\t Chemotherapies and any medications associated \nwith cancer treatments\n40\t\nChapter 3\u2003 Essential Safety Models\n", "According to McDowell, Ferner, and Ferner (2009), \nmedication errors can be thought of as having a \u201cpatho\u00ad\nphysiology\u201d in that errors can be classified in one of many \ntypes: when an action that was intended to take place is \nnot performed; when errors take place due to inadequate \nknowledge known as a mistake; when a well-formulated plan \nis not executed (slip) and an erroneous act or lapse of the \nplan occurs; or when inaccurate calculation of the required \ndose occurs. These authors stress that healthcare systems \nare complex and errors occur at various stages and steps of \norders, communication, preparation, and administration.\nImpact of Errors in Pediatric Care\nYoung children are inherently vulnerable, as they do not \nquestion or monitor their care. The impact of errors on young \nchildren exceeds the effects on adults, with such errors causing \nmore harm and having a more significant impact on pediatric \npatients\u2019 safety. Children need to be protected from errors, \nand pediatric nurses must adhere to safety protocols to \nensure that the risks of errors are reduced. The implementa\u00ad\ntion of electronic order entry and computerized medication \nadministration programs (scanning) has reduced the number \nof errors, but communication remains the single most impor\u00ad\ntant factor in errors involving pediatric patients. Reducing \nthe impact of errors in the pediatric population requires indi\u00ad\nvidual dedication, team effort, and institutional commitment.\n\u2022\t Anticoagulants\n\u2022\t Electrolytes\n\u2022\t Narcotics\nTypes of Errors in Pediatric Care\nIn general, medication errors in pediatrics can be classified \ninto one of four categories:\n\u2022\t Acts of omission\n\u2022\t Acts of commission\n\u2022\t Scheduling misperceptions\n\u2022\t Noncompliance on the part of the family or child\nOmissions are errors where a team member did not do \nor provide something for a child that should have been \nimplemented. Omitting a dose of antibiotic, forgetting \nto open the clamp on an intravenous electrolyte replace\u00ad\nment solution to correct a significant serum depletion, \nand missing a prescribed application of a topical steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug are all errors of omission.\nActs of commission occur when a pediatric team \nmember does something in error to a child that was not \nsupposed to happen. Examples include treating a child for \na condition that the child has not been diagnosed with and \nadministering a medication to a child who does not have \na standing order for this therapy.\nScheduling misperceptions involve the incorrect timing \nof a medication or treatment, such as administering a pain \nmedication before it is due or administering an antibiotic \nto a child recently transferred from the emergency depart\u00ad\nment who just received the medication in the emergency \ndepartment (i.e., giving the medication too soon after the last \ndose). Compliance concerns may arise regarding whether \nthe family participated in administering a medication or \ntreatment as it was ordered, or whether the family filled a \nprescription that was ordered for a child.\nFigure 3-6\u2002\n\u00a9 Ermolaev Alexander/Shutterstock\nBEST PRACTICES\nReducing Miscommunications and Errors by Using \nHandoff Bundles\nHandoff bundles have been shown to reduce medical errors \nin pediatric healthcare settings by reducing miscommunica\u00ad\ntion. In research conducted by Starmer et\u00a0al. (2014), the use \nof a standardized communication tool, handoff training, \nteam handoff structure, and a verbal mnemonic reduced \nerrors from 33.8 errors per 100 admissions to 18.3 errors \nper 100 admissions. Use of the SIGNOUT? mnemonic was \n\u00adrecognized as a key factor in the improved rates, along with a \n\u201cpatient summary,\u201d \u201cto-do list,\u201d and \u201ccontingency planning.\u201d \nThe SIGNOUT? mnemonic, which was developed by Horwitz, \nMoin, and Green (2007), includes the following elements:\nS = Sick? Do not resuscitate? Unstable?\nI = Identifying data, gender, weight, age, and diagnosis\nG = General course of hospitalization\nN = New events of the day, including vital signs, diagnostics, \nlab results, and medications\nO = Overall health status/clinical condition\nU = Upcoming possibilities, with their plan and rationale\nT = Tasks to complete, plan, rationale, and time frame\n? = Any questions? Concerns?\n\t\nSafety in Clinical Settings\t\n41\n", "for each age, and knowing how and to whom the nurse \nshould report a change.\nMnemonics for Safety\nMany healthcare professionals promote the use of mental \nmnemonics to encourage safe practice. Mnemonics are \nmemory tools used to rapidly recall complex informa\u00ad\ntion, sets of steps for skills, or components of treatment \nplans. Most mnemonics are intended to help practitioners \neither recall information or recall steps of behaviors. \nThese tools promote safety in that they allow for ready \nrecall of standards agreed upon in professional practice \n(Hagerman, Varughese, & Kurth, 2014). CAB is an example; \nit is used to recall the first three steps of cardiopulmo\u00ad\nnary resuscitation\u2014compression, airway, breathing. The \nBest Practices: Using Mnemonics feature highlights \nthis kind of memory tool for double-checking use of \nmedications in children.\nCommunication Tips\nThorough professional communication in the field of \npediatrics will reduce the chance of errors. Areas where \ncommunication mishaps are prone to happen include \nhandoffs between caregivers (also known as handovers, \nsign-offs, and shift reports) and handoffs between units \nor departments, such as between the emergency depart\u00ad\nment and the nursing unit, or between the nursing unit \nand the radiology department. Handoffs include not only \nthe communication of essential care information, but \nalso the transfer of primary responsibility and authority \nfor the child. Consistently using a formal handoff format \nthat provides structure, critical information, and safety \nassurance is a best practice for minimizing errors. Con\u00ad\nversely, insufficient handoffs may cause safety breaches \nand failures in safe care.\n BEST PRACTICES\n\u201cT\nime-outs\u201d are a sound safety communication technique \nthat must be used prior to any medical procedure, \nmedical diagnostic procedure, or surgical procedure. Before \nbeginning the procedure, the team involved with the child\u2019s \ncare should gather together around the child and conduct \na safety time-out. All team members should listen for and \nconfirm the accuracy of one team member\u2019s review of the \nchild\u2019s name, birthday, medical record number, presence of \na name band, ordered procedure, correct location for the \nprocedure, consent secured, parent\u2019s whereabouts during the \nprocedure and contact cell number, and a review of medica\u00ad\ntions used or anesthetic used for the procedure. The Joint \nCommission (2005) encourages that a visual reminder of the \nneed for time-outs be placed strategically in the procedural, \ntreatment, or surgical room. \nOne of the most important aspects of promoting safety \nfor children is rapidly identifying any change in the patient\u2019s \nclinical status, and then rapidly reporting the change to \nthe proper physician for guidance or orders. Children\u2019s \nconditions can change very abruptly; thus, an important \nskill for nurses is the ability to quickly assess a child and \ndiscover a change in clinical status, and then know when \nand to whom to report this change. Safety in pediatric \nnursing is based on skills that are tailored toward chil\u00ad\ndren, including knowing the expected average vital signs \nBEST PRACTICES\nUsing Mnemonics\nAn example of a mnemonic that assists with a child\u2019s safety \nis one used to remember which medications, at a minimum, \nshould be double-checked by two licensed caregivers. (Some \ninstitutions will have additional requirements, so the nurse \nshould always check the specific institution\u2019s policy.) The \nmnemonic D\u2019BITCH\u2019EN can be used to remind a caregiver \nwhich categories of medications should be doubled-checked \nwith a second nurse:\nD = Digoxin or any heart medication\nB = Blood products of any kind, including red blood cells, \nplatelets, plasma, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), \nand clotting factors\nI = Insulins and oral hypoglycemics\nT = Total parenteral nutrition and lipids\nC = Chemotherapeutics and any medication given as \npart of cancer treatments, including oral prednisone or \nintravenous steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nH = Heparin or any anticoagulant\nE = Electrolytes given to replace serum values or given \nas a treatment, such as magnesium for intractable \nasthma symptoms\nN = Narcotics or any pain medication that has the potential \nto cause altered mental status, respiratory depression, \nor any other significant symptoms\n42\t\nChapter 3\u2003 Essential Safety Models\n", "Case Study\nAt a home-based toddler care program, a 2-year-old boy \nwas playing in the backyard with 12 other children. Three \nsupervising adults were engaging in play with the other \ntoddlers. The young boy ran along the side of the home, \nover to some trashcans that had collected water during a \nrecent rainstorm. The child threw a toy into one of the cans, \nand then scrambled up onto a bush next to the trashcan \nso he could climb in and retrieve the toy. The child fell into \napproximately 9 inches of water; he was quickly found but \nwas unconscious.\nEmergency medical personnel were called and brought to \nthe scene. The child was resuscitated at the site and brought \ninto the local emergency department, where his heart rate \nafter administration of epinephrine was found to be 50 beats \nper minute, his respiratory rate was 8 breaths per minute, and \nhis blood pressure was 72/30 mm Hg. The child was admitted \ninto the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and quickly placed \non a ventilator for respiratory support.

Thinking conceptually about safety \nallows the nurse to transfer existing knowledge about \nthis issue to an actual clinical situation.\n\u25c6\u25c6Injury prevention and safety education for families \nacross developmental stages is a nursing imperative.\n\u25c6\u25c6Neither infants nor young toddlers can be expected \nto understand what is \u201csafe\u201d and what is \u201cunsafe.\u201d By a \nchild\u2019s third birthday, however, children should have \nsome understanding that certain behaviors will put \nthem in harm\u2019s way.\n\u25c6\u25c6Children require responsible adults to provide antici\u00ad\npated safety measures at home, in daycare or school \nfacilities, and on playgrounds, and they require an \nemerging sense of safety within that manifests as safe \ndecisions as they mature.\n\u25c6\u25c6Lower household income is associated with a number \nof safety issues and risk factors that clinicians should \nunderstand, assess, and help families to mitigate through \navailable resources.\n\u25c6\u25c6Pediatric nurses are in a unique position to offer antici\u00ad\npatory guidance to parents and caregivers about safety \nfor children. Safety must be ensured in play, school, \nand home environments, and nurses should provide \neducation on measures to achieve this goal.\n\u25c6\u25c6In pediatric clinical settings, thorough professional \ncommunication will reduce the risk of errors.

Over the years, demographic changes \nlinked to immigration and differing birth rates have pro\u00ad\nduced a culturally diverse population of patients as well \nas culturally diverse healthcare practitioners within the \ncountry (Table 4-1); this diversity can have a considerable \nimpact on the implementation of health care and on the \nhealthcare industry as a whole (Department of Finance, \n2013; Hearnden, 2008; Laves, Reclose, & Seaway, 2008; \nWilson-Stronks & Murtha, 2010). According to Leong, \nWieland, and Dent (2010), their cultural backgrounds \ninfluence the behavior of both patients and providers, \nregardless of the healthcare setting in which they interact. \nNotably, differences in their cultural preferences and com\u00ad\nmunication styles require individuals to listen carefully \nand negotiate and, through this process, to understand \nand overcome barriers related to their communication \npatterns.\nBoth the demographic changes and the increasing \ndiversity of the U.S. population also compel healthcare \nproviders to commit to improving culturally competent \ncare. Cultural competence entails first developing an aware\u00ad\nness of one\u2019s own cultural preferences and practices, and \nthen respecting and accepting the cultural preferences and \npractices of others (Flowers, 2004).\nCultural preferences, factors related to their ethnic back\u00ad\ngrounds, and religious and spiritual beliefs add richness to \nthe interaction between a family and a healthcare provider. \nBoth culture and ethnic diversity tend to produce exciting \nnew perspectives on worldviews, art, music, emotional \nexpression, beauty, family life, health practices, birth and \ndeath rituals, and expression (Figure 4-1). Sometimes, \nhowever, cultural and religious influences on healthcare \ndecision making may result in ethical dilemmas and cre\u00ad\nate a \u201cstorm\u201d between families and healthcare providers \n(Linnard-Palmer, 2006). Such ethical dilemmas are espe\u00ad\ncially likely to arise when a certain belief system leads to \nTABLE 4-1\u2003\nCultural Diversity\nCultural diversity is a term that refers to many groups defined on bases other than those that distinguish traditional cultural or \nethnic groups:\n\u203a\u203a\nSexual orientation, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, androsexual, skoliosexual, asexual, or questioning\n\u203a\u203a\nGender identity, such as transgender, nonbinary, or fluid\n\u203a\u203a\nDeaf culture, representing those with hearing impairments\n\u203a\u203a\nPhysical disabilities, such as the \u201cwheelchair culture\u201d\n\u203a\u203a\nGeriatric identity, representing the needs and perspectives of the older generation\n\u203a\u203a\nAdolescent identity, representing the struggles, concerns, desires, and perspectives of teens\nFigure 4-1\u2002\n\u00a9 Hero Images/Getty\na delay in treatment, refusal of treatment, or preferences \nto limit medical treatment for a child. A lack of under\u00ad\nstanding and non-appreciation of cultural influences in a \nhealthcare setting can lead to negative patient outcomes, \nincluding higher risk of making medical errors, profound \nfinancial implications, and a widened healthcare disparity \ngap (Bagchi, Ursin, & Leonard, 2012; Laves et\u00a0al., 2008). \nAccording to EthnoMed (2015), Harborview Medical \nCenter\u2019s ethnic medicine website, \u201cIt is important to \nremember that simply because a person is identified as a \nmember of a particular ethnic group or religion [it] does \nnot necessarily mean that the person or the person\u2019s fam\u00ad\nily has the set of beliefs that may be associated with the \nethnicity or religion.\u201d\nPediatric nurses are in a unique position to influence \nhealthcare outcomes through careful cultural assessments, \nnegotiations, and culturally sensitive communication, \nas the amount of time they spend directly with patients \nand families, regardless of the setting, far exceeds that \ncommitted by other healthcare providers. Therefore, it is \ncritical for a pediatric nurse to understand the cultural \npreferences and cultural communication patterns of \n48\t\nChapter 4\u2003 Cultural and Religious Influences to Care\n", "Ethnicity\nThe term ethnicity has a different meaning than the term \n\u201cculture.\u201d Ethnicity comprises the beliefs and practices of a \ngroup whose members identify with one another based on \ncommon language, ancestry, nationality, or other factors. The \ngroup\u2019s shared beliefs and practices may include childrear\u00ad\ning, food choices and preparation, dress, customs, and life \npractices such as birthing, marriage ceremonies, and death \npractices (Figure 4-3; Table 4-2). The term \u201cculture\u201d is used \nin a broader sense, whereas the term \u201cethnicity\u201d denotes \nspecific practices that are common within an ethnic group.\nReligion\nReligion is the practice of one\u2019s spiritual beliefs. Although \nreligion can be separate from one\u2019s culture or ethnicity, appre\u00ad\nciating the practice of religious faith is important in providing \nholistic care to patients and their families. Many religious \npractices are performed when a child is sick or injured. Further, \nreligions often have very specific rituals surrounding birth \nand death. Individualized prayer, group prayer, visits from \ntheir patients so as to influence patient care outcomes \nin a positive way, including by avoiding errors and by \nengaging in successful negotiations. A lack of aware\u00ad\nness of a patient\u2019s and family\u2019s cultural background and \nfailure to provide culturally competent care increase the \nstresses experienced in healthcare settings (Flowers, \n2004; Giger, 2014).\nInfluences on Health Care\nCulture\nCulture is a set of learned behaviors or beliefs that are \nshared among members of a group. Families and cultural \ngroups teach their children about cultural behaviors, \npreferences, and communication styles (Figure 4-2). \nCulture is influenced by customs, language, history, fam\u00ad\nily structure, religion, and other environmental factors \n(Bird & Osland, 2006; Giger, 2014; Migliore, 2011; Self, \nSelf, & Bell-Haynes, 2011; Soderberg & Holden, 2002; Wu, \nBatmunkh, & Lai, 2011). Cultures can be viewed as operating \nas an \u201ciceberg,\u201d with the cultural beliefs, assumptions, and \nbehaviors found deep beneath the surface and often not \nbeing seen by an outsider. Such hidden aspects of culture \ncan create misunderstandings between parties, especially \nduring communication (Chang, 2011).\nCommunication\u2014the most powerful of the various \ncultural forces that shape interactions among patients, fami\u00ad\nlies, and healthcare providers\u2014has several dimensions that \ninfluence its effectiveness. These dimensions include power \ndistance (perceptions of inequality between individuals), \nshort-term versus long-term orientation, individualism \nversus collectivism, gender roles and perception, and un\u00ad\ncertainty avoidance (Hofstede, 2001; Hofstede, Hofstede, \n& Minkov, 2005; Moran, Harris, & Moran, 2010; Rudd & \nLawson, 2007).\nFigure 4-2\u2002\n\u00a9 Portra Images/Digital Vision/Getty\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nC\nommunication and negotiations may be negatively influ\u00ad\nenced by a lack of cultural intelligence (CQ). The concept \nof cultural intelligence implies that someone with a high CQ \nwill be able to differentiate whether a behavior is driven by \nan individual\u2019s cultural background or whether that behavior \nis characteristic of a specific person (Earley & Mosakowsko, \n2004; Speedy, 2015). Some examples can clarify this concept:\n\u2022\t A response of \u201cyes\u201d during a consent interaction for a \nchild\u2019s upcoming diagnostics exam may mean that the \nindividual hears what is said, but does not imply that \nthe person agrees or understands the issue. Being able \nto interpret this response as a culturally driven commu\u00ad\nnication behavior will allow the healthcare provider to \nalter the teaching/consenting interaction and incorpo\u00ad\nrate another means to secure understanding.\n\u2022\t A person may be very sensitive to both verbal and \nnonverbal communication techniques. These tech\u00ad\nniques, which affect one\u2019s ability to talk effectively \nwith someone of another culture, can include the \nfollowing:\n\u25c6\u25c6Eye contact\n\u25c6\u25c6Tone of voice\n\u25c6\u25c6Space\n\u25c6\u25c6Silence\n\u25c6\u25c6Distance\n\u25c6\u25c6Auditory volume\n\u25c6\u25c6Body language, such as folding arms over chest\n\u25c6\u25c6Asking personal questions\n\u25c6\u25c6Touch, including needing an attendant or guardian \npresent when conducting physical exams on areas \ndeemed private\n\t\nInfluences on Health Care\t\n49\n", "family\u2019s needs.

Spirituality, \nby comparison, is a broader concept. A person\u2019s spirituality \ninfluences how that individual views situations and one expe\u00ad\nriences a sense of well-being and internal peace. Spirituality \ninfluences how a person connects to others, sees meaning in \nlife, and interacts with and finds pleasure in nature.\nA child\u2019s and family\u2019s religiosity may be structured \naround an organized religion that features a structured \nset of doctrines, techniques of worship, and shared beliefs. \nShared beliefs may include such aspects of life as choice of \nrelationships, healthcare choices, birth and death practices, \ncircumcision practices, and even food, clothing, and work \ndecisions. Spirituality is broader and more open, fluid, and \ninfluential in more personally directed aspects of an individual\u2019s \nlife. Religion is often very structured and incorporates use \nof sacred texts and prayer practices, whereas spirituality is \nunstructured, not formalized, and very personal.\nThe five major religions in the world have been described \nas Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Islam. \nWithin those major religions, healthcare decisions may be \ninfluenced by the belief practices, prayer activities, and doc\u00ad\ntrines held by the leaders and members. Influential aspects \nof religious faith on health decisions include limitations of \ncare provisions, such as the refusal of all transfused blood \nTABLE 4-2\u2003\nEthnic Groups and Healthcare Treatments\nEthnic groups known to have beliefs, doctrines, or religious influences that may affect healthcare treatments for children include \nthe following: \n\u203a\u203a\nAfrican American\n\u203a\u203a\nAmerican Indian\n\u203a\u203a\nAmhara\n\u203a\u203a\nArab\n\u203a\u203a\nAsian (South)\n\u203a\u203a\nCambodian\n\u203a\u203a\nChinese\n\u203a\u203a\nEthiopian\n\u203a\u203a\nFilipino\n\u203a\u203a\nHispanic\n\u203a\u203a\nKorean\n\u203a\u203a\nLao\n\u203a\u203a\nMein/Yao\n\u203a\u203a\nNative Hawaiian\n\u203a\u203a\nPakistani\n\u203a\u203a\nSamoan\n\u203a\u203a\nSomali\n\u203a\u203a\nSoviet Jewish\n\u203a\u203a\nUkrainian\n\u203a\u203a\nVietnamese\nData from EthnoMed.

Ideally, the assessment of \nspirituality and spiritual needs will lead to a more open \ndiscussion of these issues. According to The Joint Com\u00ad\nmission (TJC) (2008), the healthcare provider should ask \nthe family three important questions about their religious \norientation:\n\u2022\t Do you have a religious preference?\n\u2022\t Are there any spiritual or religious preferences that \nare important to you and your family?\n\u2022\t Do you wish to contact your clergy member or reli\u00ad\ngious advisor?\nOther questions to ask a child and family about their \nspiritual background and needs are as follows:\n\u2022\t How do you make sense of what has happened to \nyou?\n\u2022\t In what ways has your illness/injury/disorder af\u00ad\nfected your view of yourself or others or your \nfaith?\n\u2022\t What is your source of support for meaning in this \nlife experience?\n\u2022\t How do you decide what you could do next?\n\u2022\t Which kind of support do you currently have? \nFaith?\n\u2022\t What is your source of hope?\nSpirituality Versus Ethnicity and Culture\nSpirituality should not be confused with ethnicity or \nculture.

It is expressed through socially \ntransmitted behaviors, values, arts, and \u201chuman works \nof life.\u201d Ethnicity is more specific. For example, a group\u2019s \ncustoms such as food preparation and choices, music, \ndress, expressions of emotions, hierarchy of decision \nmaking, and language are all influenced by their ethnicity.\nIt is vitally important that a pediatric nurse working \nin an interdisciplinary team understand cultural, ethnic, \nand spiritual influences on care. Indeed, the decisions that \na family makes regarding their child\u2019s health care may be \nbased on the interwoven influences of spiritual practices, \nethnic leadership, cultural values, and religious preferences \n(Table 4-3). Understanding how the nurse\u2019s own religious \nand cultural beliefs influence daily practices and thoughts \nwill strengthen the nurse\u2019s understanding of and sensitivity \nto the influence of the same factors on a family\u2019s way of \ninteracting with the healthcare team, deciding on treat\u00ad\nment for their child, and making decisions about health, \nfood, affection, childrearing and accepting or adapting to \na situation such as injury, illness, or disease.\nproducts by Jehovah\u2019s Witness members, delays for prayer \nbefore care by several fundamental Christian organizations, \nand refusal of certain medical treatments by Christian \nScientists (Linnard-Palmer, 2006).

In the biblical chapters \nof Genesis (9:4), Acts (15:28\u200a-29) and Leviticus (17:10-12; 13-14), \nreference to abstaining from blood is tied to one\u2019s soul. In 1945, \nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses leaders made an official denouncement \nof the receipt of blood transfusion (Linnard-Palmer, 2006).\nFaithful parents who worship as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses may \nface a situation in which they must decide whether to adhere \nto their faith if their child requires blood product transfusions. \nIn cases where parents have refused consent for a lifesaving \nrequired transfusion, pediatric healthcare teams have gone \nthrough the courts to secure state guardianship for mandated \ntransfusion therapy.\nAccording to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses doctrine, the following \nprocedures are unacceptable:\n\u2022\t Whole blood transfusions\n\u2022\t Packed red blood cells transfusions\n\u2022\t Autologous blood transfusions if the tube from body \nto body is interrupted\n\u2022\t Plasma proteins transfusions\n\u2022\t Stem cell transfusions\n\u2022\t Epidural blood patches if the blood leaves the body \nand is injected back in\n\u2022\t Blood product donations (some flexibility allowed)\n\t\nInfluences on Health Care\t\n51\n", "TABLE 4-3\u2003\nReligious, Spiritual, and Belief Systems That Influence Children\u2019s Health Care\nReligious/\nSpiritual Group\nBasic Beliefs\nInfluence to Healthcare Decisions \nfor Children\nCatholic\nSickness, illness, or injury may be God\u2019s will or \nbased on sin (evident in last rites).\nPrayer is used to ask for forgiveness and \nassistance in healing.

Although the practice is illegal in all \n50 U.S. states, a pediatric nurse may encounter a female who \nwas circumcised in another country (e.g., Somaliland, Gambia, \nSierra Leone) (Sundby, Ess\u00e9n, & Johansen, 2013). Female cir\u00ad\ncumcision is performed for various cultural reasons and has \nno medical value (Tilly, 2015). The World Health Organization \n(WHO) considers this practice to be \u201cfemale genital mutilation.\u201d\nIn general, there are four types of female genital mutilation:\n\u2022\t Clitoridectomy: removal of the clitoris.\n\u2022\t Excision: partial or total removal of the clitoris and the \nlabia minora.\n\u2022\t Infibulation: may or may not involve removal of the \nclitoris. The labia majora and minora are surgically \nrepositioned to create closure or narrowing of the \nvaginal opening. A small opening for urination and \nmenstruation is kept.\n\u2022\t All other female genital mutilation procedures, such \nas piercing, scraping, and cauterizing (WHO, 2016).\nFemale genital mutilation has potentially devastating \nhealth and emotional consequences (Johnsdotter, 2015; \nWHO, 2016).

She may want the door closed during her five daily \nprayer sessions, and she will most likely pray on a rug while \nfacing the direction of Mecca. She should not be disturbed, \nand care should be planned around her spiritual needs.\nBoth cultural preferences and religious doctrines can \ninfluence pediatric healthcare decisions. Box 4-1 identifies \nthe basic tenets of several commonly encountered cultural \ngroups in the United States whose beliefs and cultural prac\u00ad\ntices influence the provision of care to children.

Box 4-3 identifies some contem\u00ad\nporary disparities in health outcomes that are predicted \nto persist into the future.\nHealth Literacy\nConsistent with the relationship between culture and \ncommunication is the concept of health literacy. Health \nliteracy has been defined as the ability of an individual \nor group to \u201cobtain, process and understand basic health \ninformation and services needed to make appropriate \nhealth decisions\u201d (U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices [USDHHS], 2003). Recognizing that health lit\u00ad\neracy highly influences clinical outcomes, safety, informed \nconsent, adherence, and compliance (USDHHS, 2003) can \nhelp guide a pediatric nurse to carefully assess a family\u2019s \nlevel of understanding. Even for families in which English \nis the first language, complex medical terms and the high \nDisparities of Health Outcomes\nThe term disparities of health outcomes is used to denote \npoorer clinical or health outcomes associated with particular \nraces (groups identified on the basis of supposedly shared \ngenetic or physical traits), ethnicities, and cultural groups due \nto, among other things, the intersection of cultural factors \nwith acceptance of therapy. It should not be confused with \nthe term healthcare disparities, which refers to differences \nin access to healthcare services among different groups.\nDisparities of health outcomes are of great concern, \nas some can be rectified by providing care that takes into \naccount the health beliefs held by various individuals and \ngroups. Some health concerns have a genetic predisposi\u00ad\ntion, such as sickle cell anemia in the African American \ncommunity, thalassemia in patients of Mediterranean \nheritage, and Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish \ncommunity. Other disparities in health outcomes relate \ndirectly to behaviors, customs, or genetics associated with \ncultural or ethnic groups. A higher incidence of hyperten\u00ad\nsion in the African American community, sudden infant \ndeath syndrome (SIDS) in the African American and Native \nAmerican communities (Pickett, Luo, & Lauderdale, 2005), \nand diabetes in the American Indian/Native Alaskan com\u00ad\nmunity, as well as differing levels of drug response or food \nsensitivities, are associated with lifestyle, diet, and cultural \npractices. Some of these cultural practices may delay screen\u00ad\ning, limit treatment options, or influence prevention. In \nanother example of disparities in health outcomes, lesbian, \ngay, and transgender youth have been disproportionally \naffected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \n(American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004).\nTrust is an important part of cultural connection, as \nsome cultural groups view traditional Western medicine \nas being patriarchal and unfair owing to its biases, rac\u00ad\nism, and exclusionary practices. Pediatric nurses are in an \nimportant position to provide education and support to \ncultural groups with higher risks for certain diseases, con\u00ad\nditions, and health states (Figure 4-6). Because disparities \nof health outcomes are harmful and lead to higher levels \nof morbidity and mortality, nurses should take steps to \nBOX 4-2\u2002 \u0007Basic Aspects of Religious Doctrines That Influence \nPediatric Healthcare Decisions\n\u2022\t Desire for prayer in place of or prior to the participa\u00ad\ntion in traditional healthcare provision\n\u2022\t Refusal, delay, or limitation of care based on religious \ndoctrine or group processes\n\u2022\t Need for elders\u2019 or church leader\u2019s influence or say in \ntreatment decisions\n\u2022\t Use of alternative healing approaches\nFigure 4-6\u2002\n\u00a9 Morsa Images/DigitalVision/Getty\nBOX 4-3\u2002 \u0007Examples of Contemporary Disparities in Health \nOutcomes\nAccording to Healthy People 2020 (U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health \nPromotion, 2017a), disparities in health outcomes reflect dif\u00ad\nferences in overall care outcomes related to low economic \nor social status, race, ethnicity, culture, and environmental \ninfluences. These disparities include the differences in the \nfollowing outcomes for specific groups:\n\u2022\t Cognitive or sensory disabilities\n\u2022\t Cancer\n\u2022\t Diabetes\n\u2022\t Hypertension\n\u2022\t Injuries and accidents leading to bodily harm\n\u2022\t Death rates associated with chronic and acute \nillnesses\n54\t\nChapter 4\u2003 Cultural and Religious Influences to Care\n", "speak a language that is not shared by all team members, a \ndisconnect may occur, in which some team members feel \nostracized and like \u201coutsiders.\u201d The communication of pa\u00ad\ntient information, reports or handoffs, and critical findings \nshould not occur solely in a language that is considered the \ncollective norm (e.g., English in the United States).

Conscious effort should be made to be inclusive, \nand safety must always be the primary concern.\nBEST PRACTICES\nApplication of Cultural Terms to Pediatric Nursing\n\u2022\t Cultural sensitivity: A culturally sensitive pediat\u00ad\nric nurse is one who understands a set of skills that \nenable the nurse to study and learn about diverse \ncultures and come to an understanding of cultural \npractices and needs.\n\u2022\t Cultural competence: A culturally competent pediat\u00ad\nric nurse is one who has developed skills in cultural \nassessment and culturally driven care.\n\u2022\t Cultural humility: A pediatric nurse with cultural hu\u00ad\nmility has an ability to see the perspectives of another \noutside of the nurse\u2019s own cultural group, especially \nthose aspects that are most important to the other.\n\u2022\t Cultural awareness: A pediatric nurse with cultural \nawareness has an ability to stand back and view other \ncultural groups as unique, distinct, important, and in\u00ad\nfluential, while demonstrating respect.\n\u2022\t Cultural beliefs: Patterns of behavior, communica\u00ad\ntion, and human encounters that are based on a \nshared and learned framework.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\u2002\nC\nulturally competent care, including the assessment of \nhealth literacy, impacts quality of care, health outcomes, \nand patient/family satisfaction. Failure to provide culturally \ncompetent care can lead to safety issues, poor healthcare \naccess, and serious adverse clinical outcomes (Brotanek, \nSeeley, & Flores, 2008).\nlevels of English-language literacy needed to understand \ntreatment plans may mean that a family does not fully \nunderstand what is happening to their child\u2019s health and \nmisses important information on care and treatment \nplans. All documents given to families should be written \nto reflect the language and literacy level of the responsible \nadult, guardian, or primary caregiver of the child (Joint \nCommission, 2007; Joint Commission, 2008).\nCultural Awareness Across Settings\nHealthcare work settings are complex and can be very \ndiverse environments. Indeed, many cultural and ethnic \ngroups may interact within the same clinical setting. Not \nonly do pediatric nurses work with and care for people \nwith diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, but the staff \nproviding the care are also influenced by their own cultural, \nethnic, and religious perspectives. If the nurse is both cul\u00ad\nturally sensitive and culturally aware, the work setting can \nbe enriched by an emerging respect for diversity and the \njoys of celebrating diversity through the sharing of health \npractices, dress, food, music, and communication styles.\nIt is important, however, to maintain a \u201cpatient-centered \ntemplate\u201d approach to pediatric health care (Javier, \nHendriksz, Chamberlain, & Stuart, 2013). This approach \nencourages the healthcare provider to view each patient \nthrough a unique lens, trying to understand this par\u00ad\nticular patient and the influences on this patient\u2019s world. \nPractitioners are cautioned not to fall into the trap of as\u00ad\nsuming that cultural factors are always central to a case \nor to follow the \u201ctrait list approach\u201d in which one assumes \nthat certain traits apply to an entire group (Kleinman & \nBenson, 2006). Doing so leads to dangerous stereotyping.\nEach member of the healthcare team should seek to \ncreate a positive and sensitive work environment in which \ndiverse perspectives and care practices are respected, valued, \nand incorporated. The value of diversity among patients, \nfamilies, groups and healthcare team members can greatly \nenrich the experience of pediatric healthcare practices.\nIt is important to be mindful of the potential for com\u00ad\nmunication disconnects. If some members of the health\u00ad\ncare team are members of a particular ethnic group and \nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nC\nhildren and their families will benefit from acknowledging \ntheir cultural heritage and practices. The pediatric healthcare \nteam should follow these guidelines:\n\u2022\t Ask the child and the parents how they want to be \naddressed.\n\u2022\t Ask the child and the family the best way to commu\u00ad\nnicate information.\n\u2022\t Be aware of accommodation needs, such as using an \ninterpreter for communicating important medical and \nnursing information and waiting until the family\u2019s pri\u00ad\nmary decision maker is present before consenting to \nor compromising on treatment or discharge plans.\n\u2022\t Be aware of the need to adjust to physical, cultural, \nand spiritual preferences relating to visiting hours, pri\u00ad\nvate family time, religious and spiritual practice needs \n(prayer time), and dietary customs.\n\t\nCultural Awareness Across Settings\t\n55\n", "child receives required medical care. Table 4-5 lists some \nreligious and sociopolitical groups with doctrines that \nhave been known to influence pediatric medical treat\u00ad\nment decisions.\nIt is imperative that pediatric nurses understand their \nrole in the sometimes distressing scenario of treatment \nrefusal, delay, or limitation. All members of the health\u00ad\ncare team must be aware of and identify when families of \ndiverse cultures or religious groups refuse treatment; they \nmust know their state laws, know how to act quickly, and \nacknowledge that the situation is an ethical dilemma that \nrequires communication and decision making by staff, \nadministration, and family members. Table 4-6 offers \nguidelines for staff who encounter parental refusal, delay, \nor limitation of health care for children. Many factors af\u00ad\nfect parental delay, limitation, or refusal of medical care \nfor children, but cultural and religious beliefs are among \nthe most influential, problematic, and distressing for both \nthe healthcare team and the faithful family.\nCultural Assessment and Cultural Considerations\nA number of cultural assessment tools can provide a \nstructure for nurses to provide culturally driven care for \npediatric patients and their families. A meta-analysis by \nHigginbottom and colleagues (2011) identified eight such \ntools that were informed by rigorous research perspec\u00ad\ntives; the first of these tools to be developed\u2014Leininger\u2019s \nSunrise Model (Leininger, 1997)\u2014has been analyzed and \ncritiqued repeatedly during the past decades. More recent \nmodels described in the analysis include the Culturally \nCompetent Community Care (CCCC) model developed \nby Kim-Godwyn and colleagues (2001); the Family Cul\u00ad\ntural Heritage Assessment Tool (FAMCHAT) created by \n\u00adDavidson et\u00a0al. (2001); and the ACCESS model (Assessment, \nCommunication, Cultural negotiation and Compromise, \nEstablishing respect and rapport, Sensitivity, Safety) de\u00ad\nveloped by Narayanasamy (2002).\nSometimes, just asking the right questions at the right \ntime to the right family member will allow for a kind and \nsupportive conversation that increases cultural understand\u00ad\ning. Questions can include how the nurse and healthcare \nteam can provide the best care for the child and the family. \nQuality questions asked in a supportive tone can make \na person feel respected and valued. Table 4-4 lists some \ncultural questions that can provoke disclosure of the fam\u00ad\nily\u2019s cultural background and associated preferences and \nneeds. A nurse should be aware of each family\u2019s cultural \npractices and needs if the nurse is to assure trust, complete \ndisclosure, and collaboration.\nParental Refusal of Medical Treatment\nAmong certain religious and cultural groups, their beliefs \nand doctrines may influence whether a family will consent \nfor treatment, refuse treatment, delay seeking medical care, \nor limit which medical care their child receives. Treat\u00ad\nment refusal is complicated when the child is a minor and \ntreatments are considered essential or lifesaving. Some \nreligious doctrines require that families refuse certain \nforms of medical care, or that they seek \u201cprayer heal\u00ad\ning\u201d prior to or instead of traditional medical care (Offit, \n2015). In other instances, parents may hold sociopolitical \nconcepts about science and medicine (e.g., anti-vaccine \nor anti-pharmaceutical sentiments) that conflict with the \nstandard of care required to adequately treat the child\u2019s \nhealth issue.\nIn cases where the child is critically ill, refusal or delay \nof medical care rooted in religious practice or sociopolitical \nconcepts can be life threatening. Most states have laws that \nprotect the health and well-being of a child by preventing \nparental authority from superseding a child\u2019s safety. Most \nstates also have laws that allow the state to take guardian\u00ad\nship of a child for a specific time period to make sure the \nTABLE 4-4\u2003\n\u0007Cultural Questions for the Disclosure of \nCultural Needs\n\u203a\u203a\n\u201cWhich ethnic group or cultural group do you identify \nwith?

The \nchild is from a Sri Lankan immigrant family; her father has \na limited command of English and the mother speaks only \nTamil. The mother works two jobs to care for her three \nchildren, and the father works in another city and has a \nmore than 90-minute commute each day. On this visit, the \nmother is the only parent present. Using interpreter ser\u00ad\nvices, the mother explains that the health condition of the \nchild and the frequently required clinic visits are imposing \nstress on the family. The child is very shy and fights against \nhaving any physical exams performed. She also protests \nloudly when her implanted port needs to be accessed for \nlaboratory draws or chemotherapy infusions. The mother \nbreaks down in tears and asks if there is a way to combine \nAyurvedic medicine administered at home with fewer \ntraditional Western medical treatments at the clinic and \nhospital for her daughter\u2019s condition.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t How can the healthcare team provide culturally sensitive \ncare to this family during this clinic visit?\n2.\t For clarity, which questions should be asked of the mother \nconcerning her desire to provide Ayurvedic medicine with \ntraditional Western medical treatments?\n3.\t For safety, how can the team provide care to the child \nwho is fighting against physical exams and access to her \nimplanted port?\nfamilies, and patients. The 15 standards are divided into \nfour main categories, including principles of the standards, \ngovernance and leadership, language and communication, \nand engagement. Five of the CLAS standards closely relate \nto the professional practice of family-centered care and \npediatric nursing:\n1.\t Provide safe, effective, equitable, respectful, and \nunderstandable care and services that take into ac\u00ad\ncount diversity, cultural beliefs and practices, literacy, \nlanguages, and communication requirements.\n2.\t Recruit and support a workforce that is culturally \ndiverse and represents many languages.\n3.\t Participate in continued education on cultural di\u00ad\nversity and diverse cultural healthcare practices.\n4.\t Engage in assessment of the healthcare institution\u2019s \nCLAS-related policies, goals, and practices.\n5.\t Create conflict, grievance, and resolution skills and \npractices that will allow a healthcare team and fam\u00ad\nily to resolve issues related to diverse perspectives \nand needs.\nIn 2010, a review of implementation of these policies \nfound that only a very small number of hospital facilities \nmet the standards completely; indeed, more facilities met \nnone of the standards than met\u00a0all of them (Diamond, \nWilson-Stronks, & Jacobs, 2010).

The pediatric nurse\u2019s care should be \nbased on assessment, understanding, and application \nof care processes that take into account a child\u2019s and \nfamily\u2019s belief systems and cultural practices.\n\u25c6\u25c6Tools and guidelines are available to guide pediatric \nnurses\u2019 and healthcare teams\u2019 assessments of a family\u2019s \ncultural and religious needs. The findings can be used to \ndetermine which cultural and religious practices influence \nthe medical and nursing treatment plans, and can inform \nthe development of a respectful and mutual care plan that \nboth the team and the family can understand. Specific \nquestions should be posed early in the health encounter to \nclarify what is needed to provide culturally sensitive care.\n\u25c6\u25c6Cultural awareness, cultural sensitivity, cultural humility, \nand cultural competence across pediatric healthcare set\u00ad\ntings are goals of effective family-centered care. A pediatric \nnurse should be committed to lifelong learning about diverse \ncultures, ethnic groups, and religious frameworks so that \nthe nurse can continue to practice with safety and respect.\n\u25c6\u25c6Religious beliefs can be highly influential in pediatric \nand family care, including pediatric care treatment deci\u00ad\nsions. Some religious groups desire a delay in treatment \nfor prayer first, seek to limit treatments based on their \nbeliefs, or refuse treatments. A pediatric nurse should be \nable to identify and understand those specific religious \nfaiths whose doctrines influence care.\n\u25c6\u25c6The term \u201cdisparities in health outcomes\u201d denotes poorer \nclinical or health outcomes associated with particular \nraces, ethnicities, and cultural groups.

These team members may \nbe found across clinical settings\u2014from providers of outpa\u00ad\ntient services to home care providers to providers during \nprevious hospitalizations.\nPrioritizing the child\u2019s needs is essential. If a child presents \nto the emergency department with respiratory syncytial \nvirus (RSV)\u2012related bronchiolitis and pneumonia, but is \nfound to have evidence of physical child abuse or neglect, \nthe team must provide for the child\u2019s immediate health \ncare needs first. They must also piece together the puzzle \nof associated concerns and communicate with previous \ncare providers, including social services and government \nagencies such as Child Protective Services (CPS), which \ninvestigates cases and protects children from further abuse \nor maltreatment. Much more so than with adult patients, \nthe vulnerability of a child requires all healthcare team \nmembers to work closely together, communicate assess\u00ad\nments findings and concerns, and work collaboratively \nto create a comprehensive and agreed-upon plan of care.\nTeam Members\nThe provision of pediatric health care requires team mem\u00ad\nbers identify and communicate the needs of the child, and \nsubsequently plan for treatment and care. When children \nare hospitalized with continuing medical needs, the team \nmust work with case managers, home-care providers, \ncommunity services, and the child\u2019s regular healthcare \nprovider and office. The child might require services such \nas therapy, follow-up laboratory tests or diagnostic exams, \nand consultations with specialists (i.e., healthcare profes\u00ad\nsionals with extensive knowledge in a particular area). The \nQuality and Safety: Communicating with Team \u00adMembers \nbox identifies team members who may potentially be \n\u00adinvolved with providing holistic and comprehensive care \nto children and their families (Figure 5-1).\nIntroduction\nCommunication\u2014defined as the sharing of information \nand meaning\u2014is an essential part of safe pediatric health \ncare. Communication needs to be accurate, concise, and \npurposeful if care is to be coordinated and safe. During \nevery encounter, the pediatric nurse is instrumental in \nproviding information to team members, to outside agen\u00ad\ncies and referrals, and, most importantly, to the family. \nUnfortunately, miscommunication remains the primary \nsource of medical and medication errors. Nurses can be \nleaders in decreasing errors by providing clear communi\u00ad\ncation using a structured approach.\nComplexities in working with children require that team \nmembers communicate clearly, thoroughly, professionally, \nand often with urgency. Identifying healthcare problems in \nchildren often requires that members of an interdisciplinary \nteam work closely together to provide for the needs of the \nchild and family; such a team comprises a group of healthcare \nprofessionals from diverse fields who work in a coordinated \nfashion toward a common goal for the patient. In an envi\u00ad\nronment characterized by high unemployment rates, insur\u00ad\nance coverage concerns, frequent geographical moves for \nemployment, high divorce rates, and increasing diversity \nin languages, cultures, and lifestyles, families can present \nwith complicated needs requiring a team effort to meet \nthem. Sometimes it takes immediate action to care for a \nchild and family while they are in the healthcare arena, \nbefore they leave and the team misses the opportunity to \nprovide continued care.\nThis chapter presents ideas about how strong commu\u00ad\nnication skills between interdisciplinary team members \ncan be fostered and implemented. If a child presents with \nan exacerbation of a chronic illness such as type 1 diabetes \nmellitus, severe asthma, or cystic fibrosis, the team must \nfirst identify the child\u2019s immediate healthcare needs, then \nidentify the professional team members who have been \n(continues)\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nCommunicating with Team Members\nCommunication among members of interdisciplinary teams \nis imperative for safe outcomes. Members of the team may \ninclude personnel who fill the following roles:\n\u2022\t Advanced practice team members: Clinical nurse specialists, \nmidwives, pediatric nurse practitioners, nurse anesthe\u00ad\ntists, and other advanced practice clinicians who create \ncare and treatment plans that include team approaches.\n\u2022\t Child Life: Specialists who create a plan for recre\u00ad\national play, therapeutic play, education, distraction, \nmedical play, and schoolwork. Their roles may include \ncontacting the child\u2019s school to plan for missed work \nor arranging for a teacher to come to the hospital to \nhelp the child stay current and engaged.\n\u2022\t Child Protective Services: Authorities who provide im\u00ad\nmediate assistance to the team if child maltreatment is \nsuspected or confirmed; they are tasked with creating \nand coordinating a safe plan of care for a child with \nconfirmed maltreatment.\n\u2022\t Child psychologists: Mental health professionals who sup\u00ad\nport children through difficult emotional times, evaluate \nthe child\u2019s mental health concerns or needs as well as \ndevelopmental functioning level, and create a plan of care \n62\t\nChapter 5\u2003 Working and Communicating with an Interdisciplinary Team\n", "Communication Techniques\nEstablishing a therapeutic relationship is a central task \nfor nurses working with children and families (Roberts, \nFenton, & Barnard, 2015). In a therapeutic relationship, \nthe nurse uses a style of communication that puts a per\u00ad\nson at ease, makes the individual feel reassured knowing \nthat he or she is being taken seriously, and allows patients \nand families to express their concerns, questions, and \nemotions. Therapeutic relationships improve motivation \nand promote empowerment, the process through which \na family comes to feel competent to provide care for their \nchild (Collins, 2015).

The nurse, in any \nsetting, must give his or her full attention, establish trust, \nprovide care, and communicate all pertinent information \nto all team members.\nwith their perception of the quality of communication\u2014\nwhether it is communication between the team and the \nfamily (Corlett & Twycross, 2006; October et\u00a0al., 2016) or \ncommunication among team members (Giambra, Stiffler, & \nBroome, 2014; Khan et\u00a0al., 2015).\nA therapeutic relationship is goal oriented, has a defini\u00ad\ntive purpose, and ends with closure. The development of \nan effective therapeutic relationship requires 12 elements \nto be in place (Collins, 2015; Nursing Association of New \nBrunswick, 2000; Pullen & Mathias, 2010):\n1.\t Establishing rapport with child and family\n2.\t Showing respect to all members\n3.\t Building trust by being honest, genuine, and au\u00ad\nthentic in all relationships; never making promises \none cannot keep and never breaching privacy or \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct (HIPAA) guidelines\n4.\t Actively listening to the child and family while main\u00ad\ntaining eye contact, direct attention, and solicitation \nof concerns, feelings, and emotions\n5.\t Being aware of one\u2019s verbal and nonverbal \ncommunication\n6.\t Showing empathy, understanding, and concern\n7.\t Providing conflict management using creativity, \nclarification of feelings, negotiation techniques, \nand safety\n8.\t Clarifying, verbally and nonverbally, the true con\u00ad\ncerns of the child and family\n9.\t Maintaining professional boundaries; not sharing \npersonal information (e.g., via social media)\n10.\t Using humor when appropriate to encourage dis\u00ad\nclosure of feelings and promote relaxation\n11.\t Being aware of feelings of inequality, shyness, resis\u00ad\ntance to disclosure, or any other boundaries that might \nprevent the establishment of a therapeutic relationship\n12.\t Acknowledging when a therapeutic relationship \nis experiencing closure and being forthcoming in \nrespectful goodbyes\nThe pediatric nurse\u2019s role in developing a therapeutic \nrelationship is to develop trust, solicit information, support \nthe child and family, and offer solutions and education. \nBecause the pediatric nurse has more contact with a child \nand family during a hospitalization than any other team \nmember, it is important to understand the meaning of this \nrelationship, do the \u201cconnecting work\u201d needed to support \nthe family, and act as the \u201cglue\u201d by identifying what the \nfamily needs and how to get it. The therapeutic relationship \nis a positive alliance in which the nurse\u2013patient relation\u00ad\nship is based on trust, respect, sensitivity, helpfulness, and \n\u00ademotional/spiritual support (Pullen & Mathias, 2010).

In high-stress environments, including the \nsometimes chaotic healthcare environment, it is helpful \nto use tools to organize one\u2019s thinking before and during \ncommunication between team members. Learning to be \nconfident and organized during professional communication \nexchanges takes practice. Three tools\u2014SBAR, CUS, and \nhandoffs\u2014have been shown to improve the effectiveness \nof interdisciplinary communication.\n64\t\nChapter 5\u2003 Working and Communicating with an Interdisciplinary Team\n", "Handoff Processes\nAn integral part of interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary \ncommunication is the passing or transfer of critical informa\u00ad\ntion and responsibility between healthcare providers through \nhandoffs. Structured handoffs can be of enormous assistance \nwhen time is of the essence or the situation has a critical \ncomponent. Although the literature includes many recom\u00ad\nmendations for specific handoff procedures and processes \n(see Best Practices: Strategies for Effective Handoffs), it is \nimportant that teams identify which set of processes is most \nlikely to work in the context of their specific patient-care setting \nand given the needs of the individual patient and family. Team \nmembers should contribute to the discussion at patient intake \nand evaluate how the processes worked (or did not work) at \ndischarge or, in the case of long-term patient care, at intervals \nthroughout the care process. It may be useful to identify a \nnurse case manager or patient advocate to coordinate complex \nStructuring Communications with SBAR\nThe SBAR protocol, which was developed by the military \nand adopted by a network of physicians and nurses from \nKaiser Permanente, is a mnemonic that represents a series \nof steps to organize one\u2019s thinking prior to communicating \n(Institute for Health Care Improvement, 2015). It provides \nstructure when communicating with others in high-pressure \nor stressful situations. Using SBAR allows a nurse, or any \nother team member, to prepare for a conversation. Com\u00ad\nmunication that follows this protocol is purposive, direct, \nand structured to promote an exchange of information \nbetween communicating parties such as a bedside nurse or \nclinic nurse and a primary care provider, while maximizing \nclarity and securing a plan.\nSBAR includes four elements:\n\u2022\t Situation: A concise description of the problem at \nhand.\n\u2022\t Background: A brief summary of information re\u00ad\nlated to the problem at hand (i.e., what led up to the \nproblem).\n\u2022\t Assessment: A summary of what was found and is \npertinent to the problem, such as the nurse\u2019s most \nrecent assessment of the child.\n\u2022\t Recommendation: A request for action in the \nform of a recommendation to help alleviate the \nproblem.\nNurses can benefit from the structure of SBAR when \nthey face a clinical problem that must be communicated. \nThis protocol, which is considered the healthcare in\u00ad\ndustry\u2019s best practice for standardized communication, \npromotes safety and quality by providing an efficient \nand well-structured format. SBAR is particularly helpful \nfor new nurses who might feel uncertain about calling \nphysicians to report changes in clinical status that need \nrapid interventions.\nThe CUS Protocol for Expressing Concerns\nExpressing concerns can be difficult in certain \ncircumstances\u2014for instance, if a nurse is new to a \nteam or setting, if there is a power differential in the \nrelationship, or if the changes in process or status are \nhappening rapidly. Using the CUS protocol allows for \nthe expression of concerns in a respectful and profes\u00ad\nsional manner.

For \npediatric nurses, the information that is shared during shift \nchanges, as well as the latest information found on current \nassessments and care, is communicated during rounding.\nA huddle is a brief communication process that takes place \nin nursing healthcare settings such as nursing units in the \nhospital or nursing desks at clinics; it allows nursing admin\u00ad\nistration and nursing care teams to exchange information. \nThis quick meeting is focused on functional work, with the \npersonnel present discussing the plan for the day, reviewing \nsafety tips, delegating work to huddle members, and updat\u00ad\ning administration on any specific needs of families. Huddles \nare typically held at the beginning of the day or the shift, but \nwhen a complication arises, a huddle can be called to bring \nkey team players together to solicit advice or solve problems. \nIt is not uncommon that representatives from many pediatric \ndisciplines are present and actively contribute to huddles. \nMedicine, Child Life, Social Workers, Pharmacy and members \nof Nursing Administration may be present with the goal to \nreduce errors, strengthen follow-through, and improve care. \n\t\nTechniques and Tools for Interdisciplinary Communication\t\n65\n", "\u2022\t Code status and level of severity (i.e., condition is \ncurrently stable, guarded or critical in nature)\n\u2022\t Recent medications administered or medications \nsoon to be due (emphasis on medications admin\u00ad\nistered in another department requiring re-timing, \nserum therapeutic levels, required patient or family \neducation, or any consideration to medication safety)\n\u2022\t Any other pertinent data related to the child\u2019s con\u00ad\ndition or status\ninteractions involving multiple handoffs: Such coordination \nnot only helps the team to avoid errors, but also increases \nthe parents\u2019 and family members\u2019 understanding of who is \non the team and what their role is in caring for the child.\nEssential Formats for Handoffs\nSafe and thorough handoffs also reduce errors. Nurses \nshould share specific data about a child prior to handing \nthe care of the child off to another healthcare professional \n(Figure 5-3). According to The Institute of Medicine (2001), \n\u201cit is in inadequate handoffs that safety often fails first.\u201d \nComponents of a safe handoff should include the following:\n\u2022\t Demographics, including age, developmental stage, \nweight, allergies, and medical diagnosis\n\u2022\t The child\u2019s current condition, associated previ\u00ad\nous hospitalizations and any recent or anticipated \nchanges in the child\u2019s condition\n\u2022\t Up-to-date information on treatments, care needs, \norders, lab values, and results of diagnostics\nFigure 5-3\u2002 Example of a handoff sheet. \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nP\nroblems with ineffective handoffs affect the team function. \nHaving to go back, find who gave the report, and clarify \nmissing information takes time and creates havoc, breaches, \nfailures, and gaps in vital information.

According to \nFrank et\u00a0al.

It also refers to the extent to which individuals \nand groups accept the fact that inequality exists in society \n(Hofstede, 2001; Hofstede & Hofstede, 2005). As a result \nof power distance, communication barriers can develop \nbetween individuals who are perceived as having differing \namounts of power. This imbalance, in turn, impacts the \nnonverbal aspects of communication (Richardson & Smith, \n2007). When a perception of high power distance exists, \npersons deemed to have less power tend to be more polite, \nshow more respect, and express agreement (whether they \nactually agree or not) in the presence of the person with \nthe perceived higher power.\nIn the United States, power distance can be perceived \nto be very low. As such, it is common practice to address \nindividuals by their first names irrespective of their \npositions in a perceived hierarchy. At the same time, dif\u00ad\nferential status may be accorded to some providers due \nto greater specialization of practice or training than to \nothers who are equally engaged in patient care (Zwaren\u00ad\nstein, Rice, Gotlib-Conn, Kenaszchuk, & Reeves, 2013). \nIn U.S. healthcare settings, which are often characterized \nby rich cultural diversity, healthcare providers are often \nseen to have higher power distance, since they have ex\u00ad\npertise that a patient does not possess. Unfortunately, \nthe concept of power distance may also result in ineq\u00ad\nuities and disparities in health care (Joint Commission, \n2007, 2008).\nPerceptions of power distance can be detrimental to \nthe relationships among healthcare providers on a team \nas well as to the relationships between healthcare provid\u00ad\ners and family members. Errors may be introduced when \nhigher-ranking team members (physicians or specialists) \nfail to communicate effectively with other team members \ndue to power distance. In one study focused on intrapro\u00ad\nfessional communication, interactions among nursing \nand allied health professionals were frequent and in-\ndepth, but few of these discussions involved physicians \n(Zwarenstein et\u00a0al., 2013). For the most part, physician \ncommunication was limited to discussions with other \nphysicians; when it included non-physicians, the discus\u00ad\nsion was often \u201cone-way\u201d in nature (Reeves et\u00a0al., 2009). \nSuch issues must be addressed if the team is to function \neffectively.\nGreater power distance can add to errors if family \nmembers perceive that they are on an unequal footing, \nhold back information, do not disclose pertinent cultural \npractices, or simply do not wish to share their family \nhealth practices. Pediatric nurses must act as the conduit \nbetween a family and the healthcare team by whom the \nfamily feels intimidated.\nBarriers to Effective Communication\nChallenges in establishing effective communication are \nreal. The diversity and uniqueness of people, previous \nexperiences with healthcare teams, and the environment \nin which communication takes place all influence whether \na therapeutic relationship can be developed and fostered. \nIn general, two types of barriers may hinder effective \ncommunication: physical barriers that need attention, \nand psychosocial barriers that need to be acknowledged \nand overcome.\nPhysical barriers:\n\u2022\t Physical space\u2014crowding, lack of privacy, distrac\u00ad\ntions (e.g., a television or computer taking attention \nfrom the speakers and listeners)\n\u2022\t Acoustics and ambient noise\n\u2022\t Qualities of the environment such as temperature, \nlighting, and seating\nPsychosocial barriers:\n\u2022\t The emotional state of communicating parties \n(stressful healthcare environments and the child\u2019s \nacute state can add to distress)\n\u2022\t Trust within and between communicating persons\n\u2022\t Previous experiences with pediatric healthcare \nteams\n\u2022\t Cultural beliefs, expectations, and personal values \nthat may influence effective communication\n\u2022\t Resistance to new processes and procedures or new \ntechnology\nPower Distance\nPower distance is a term used to capture the feelings and \nperceptions of inequality that exist between people and \nBEST PRACTICES\u2002 (continued)\n\u2022\t Utilize the safety of \u201cread backs\u201d or \u201ccheck backs\u201d if \nchecking, clarifying, or receiving orders.\n\u2022\t Use a standardized handoff report form accepted by \nyour institution.\n\u2022\t Be smooth, accurate, and clear between units (such \nas the emergency department and the pediatric unit) \nand ensure there is no change in quality or compre\u00ad\nhensiveness between the care units.\n\u2022\t Use technology to enhance handoffs.\nData from Joint Commission, International Center for Patient Safety. \n(2005).

The parents both work full-time, \nhave no respite infant care, and depend on each other to flex \ntheir demanding work schedules to attend to the twins. The \nfather expressed concern about the girls\u2019 persistent crying and \ntheir changing eating patterns.\nUpon assessment, the pediatric nurse noticed extreme crying \nduring a diaper change. The ED staff ordered an X-ray of one \nof the girl\u2019s lower extremities and found a hair-line fracture on \nthe inner aspect of the femur. Both girls underwent a complete \nskeletal survey, and the second twin demonstrated a healing \nfracture on the left fourth rib.\nThe mother, when interviewed in private, broke down in \ntears and described verbal threats, yelling, and physical abuse \nmeted out by her husband and asked for help. Subsequently, \nthe infants were placed on a police hold. After their acute \nhealthcare needs were met, they were transferred under the \ndirection of Child Protective Services to a medical foster home \nfor care while an investigation of the potential abuse and \nneglect was conducted. The smooth interdisciplinary team \ncommunication efforts ensured a rapid sequence of safety \nand extended care.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t Who were the members of the healthcare team who \nprovided for the safety of the family?\nWritten Communication\nCurrent professional practice requires pediatric nurses to \nuse a variety of written communication techniques. These \ntechniques include electronic medical charting, sharing of \nelectronic charting between departments and institutions, \nand confirmation of the accuracy of electronic checklists, \nnotes, and entries. Computerized communication may be \nbrief and concise\u2014but unless the nurse takes a cautious \napproach, excessive brevity can lead to legal consequences. \nIt is imperative that attention is given to learning electronic \ncharting techniques and adhering to institutional policy and \nprotocols concerning charting, as failure to do so has been \nassociated with an increased rate of errors (Jylh\u00e4, Bates, & \nSaranto, 2016). The value of electronic communications in \ndecreasing power distance among healthcare professionals \nhas also been noted (Zwarenstein et\u00a0al., 2013).\nCulture and Power Distance\nConsider a scenario in which a Chinese immigrant father of \na two-year-old girl who was recently diagnosed with leuke\u00ad\nmia expresses to the nurse\u2014and only to the nurse\u2014that he \ndoes not intend to sign consent forms for diagnostic exams, \nchemotherapy protocols, or surgical procedures such as the \ninsertion of a central line. The father tells the nurse that \nhe will be taking the child away from the large healthcare \nsetting and plans to use traditional Chinese medicine to \ntreat his child. When asked if he discussed this intention \nwith the interdisciplinary team, the father says no, as he \nfelt \u201cbombarded with information,\u201d \u201cnot respected\u201d for \nhis culture, \u201cnot listened to,\u201d and \u201cnot allowed to speak.\u201d \nThe father describes feeling intimidated and believes that \nif he shared his intent for treatment for his child, the team \nmembers would not respect him. Further care conferences \nheld between the family and the oncology team that focus \non reducing feelings of power distance ultimately may lead \nto the father\u2019s consenting to combine Western medicine with \nChinese cultural practices to treat his daughter\u2019s leukemia.\nAs illustrated in this scenario, if the nurse finds that \nfamily members are demonstrating evidence of power \ndistance or feelings of inequality, further support is needed. \nThe pediatric nurse is in a key position to provide support; \nto encourage patients and families to speak up, express \nconcerns, and give cultural guidance; and to work with \nteam members who might be seen as intimidating by the \nparents, child, and extended family.\nBEST PRACTICES\nE\narly in the care process, the registered nurse should identify \nthe primary decision maker for the family, who may not \nalways be the person one expects. Establishing an effective \nline of communication with the primary decision maker for the \nchild and family will allow for rapid education on the plan of \ncare, consent when needed, clarification of critical information, \nexpedited agreement to care and treatments, adherence to the \nplan of care, and compliance with home care and follow-up. \n(continues)\n68\t\nChapter 5\u2003 Working and Communicating with an Interdisciplinary Team\n", "Bibliography\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Communication needs to be accurate, concise, and \npurposeful if care is to be coordinated and safe. During \nevery encounter, the pediatric nurse is instrumental in \nproviding information to team members, to outside agen\u00ad\ncies and referrals, and, most importantly, to the family.\n\u25c6\u25c6Complexities in working with children require that \nteam members communicate clearly, thoroughly, profes\u00ad\nsionally, and often with urgency. Identifying healthcare \nproblems in children often requires that an interdisci\u00ad\nplinary team work closely together to provide for the \nneeds of the child and family.\n\u25c6\u25c6Use of successful communication techniques is supported \nby the health science literature, including SBAR, CUS, \nand safe handoff procedures and practice.\n\u25c6\u25c6Two types of barriers may hinder effective communication: \nphysical barriers that need attention, and psychosocial \nbarriers that need to be acknowledged and overcome.\n\u25c6\u25c6Power distance (the perception of inequality between \npeople or parties) is a very real concern and poses \nchallenges to effective communication, both within \ninterdisciplinary teams and between team members \nand patients\u2019 families.\n\u25c6\u25c6Written communication is an important part of team\u00ad\nwork. Techniques include electronic medical charting, \nsharing of electronic charting between departments \nand institutions, and confirmation of the accuracy of \nelectronic checklists, notes, and entries.\nCase Study\u2002 (continued)\n2.\t How can interdisciplinary team members best com\u00ad\nmunicate to ensure all aspects of this complicated case \nare addressed?\n3.\t Which tools can be used for interdisciplinary team \ncommunication?\nAs the Case Evolves.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nSuppose that during the process of examining the twin girls, \none of the attending clinicians noted a bluish tint in the sclera \nof one child\u2019s eyes.

Pediatric nurses must know what to expect \nregarding an infant\u2019s growth and development if they are \nto provide anticipatory guidance to parents and caregivers.\nThe infant developmental stage is marked by rapid growth \nin height, weight, head circumference, and body mass index, \nwhich are collectively referred to as anthropometric mea\u00ad\nsurements. Infants typically can be expected to double their \nbirth weight by 6 months of age and triple their birth weight \nby 1 year. Height typically increases by 50% from birth to 1 \nyear of age. This tremendous growth influences the infant\u2019s \nmotor ability. The infant learns to hold her head up within \na few weeks of life and may be walking by her first birthday. \nProviding safety as the infant masters these motor milestones \nis one of the most important roles and responsibilities of \ncaregiving during the infancy period (Figure 6-1).\nThe infant developmental stage is divided into three \ndistinct periods: the neonatal period (birth to 28 days), \nthe young infancy period (1 month to 6 months), and the \nolder infancy period (6 months to 1 year). Each time frame \nhas unique cognitive and motor milestones.\nNeonates\nNeonates, who must adapt to extrauterine life, experience \nthe highest rate of infant mortality. The majority of neonates \nwho die due to congenital anomalies, complications of \nbirth, complications of prematurity, or a life-threatening \ncondition, will die within the first week after birth, with \none-fourth of those deaths occurring within the first \n24 hours of life (Jehan et\u00a0al., 2009). The stability of the \ntransition from the uterine environment and the first few \nhours to days of life depends on the infant\u2019s ability to es\u00ad\ntablish and maintain a healthy breathing pattern.\nWhen caring for a neonate, the pediatric nurse should \nhave access to the patient\u2019s birth history and Apgar scores; \nboth provide information on the stability of the newborn\u2019s \nfirst few hours and days of life. Apgar scores, which assess \nthe stability of the newborn, are performed at 1 minute and \nagain at 5 minutes of life (Box 6-1; Figure 6-2). If the score \nis less than 7, assessment is repeated at 1-minute intervals \nuntil the newborn is stable (National Library of Medicine, \n2015). The 1-minute score informs healthcare providers how \nthe neonate tolerated the process of birthing. The 5-minute \nscore indicates how the neonate is adapting to breathing and \nextrauterine life. The lower the score, the more interventions \nFigure 6-1\u2002 The infant developmental stage is marked by rapid growth.\n\u00a9 FatCamera/E+/Getty\nFigure 6-2\u2002 Apgar scores assess the stability of the newborn \n\u00adimmediately after birth.\n\u00a9 Brian McEntire/Shutterstock\n\t\nNeonates\t\n73\n", "lipase production; poor storage of glycogen, which \nincreases the risk of hypoglycemia; and increased \nregurgitation risk from the immature cardiac \nsphincter valve at the base of the esophagus.\n\u2022\t Neonates have a primarily cartilage-based muscu\u00ad\nloskeletal system, rather than bone tissue.\nFigure 6-3\u2002 Areas of stored brown fat on a neonate.\nBOX 6-1\u2003\nApgar Scoring\nThis system for scoring the stability of newborns was first developed in 1952 by anesthesiologist Dr. Virginia Apgar. The tool is \nimplemented for all births; the newborn is scored twice, at 1 minute and 5 minutes, with repeated measures as indicated for a \nscore of less than 7. Total scores can range from 0 to 10. For most institutions, any score of less than 7 provokes further assess\u00ad\nment and possible immediate interventions to support the newborn\u2019s transition (tactile stimulation, nasal and oral suctioning, \noxygen, chest compressions, etc.).\nClassic Component\nAcronym\nScore of 0\nScore of 1\nScore of 2\nColor\nAppearance\nBlue/pale over entire \nbody\nAcrocyanosis\nBody pink\nBody and extremities \npink\nHeart rate\nPulse\nAbsent\n< 100\n\u2265 100\nReflex irritability\nGrimace\nNo response to \nstimulation\nGrimace/weak cry \nwhen stimulated\nCry or attempt to pull \naway when stimulated\nMuscle tone\nActivity\nNone\nSome flexion\nFlexed extremities that \nresist extension\nRespiratory efforts\nRespirations\nAbsent\nWeak, irregular, \ngasping\nStrong cry\nReproduced from Apgar, V.

Health con\u00ad\ncerns arising during the neonatal period that may bring \nthe infant into the pediatric acute care setting include \nfevers of unknown origin, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory \ndistress, and jaundice. Premature infants, low-birth-weight \ninfants, and those with congenital anomalies are more \nlikely to need acute care. In the acute setting, neonates \nmay require monitoring devices and observation; for \nexample, if a neonate experiences a brief, resolved, \nunexplained event (BRUE; previously described as an \napparent life-threatening event [ALTE]), the neonate \nwill be placed on an apnea monitor (Figure 6-5) and \nwill likely need long-term follow-up (Rabasco et\u00a0al., \n2016; Tieder et\u00a0al., 2016).\nDevelopmental Theory\nIn all settings in which they work, members of the pediatric \nhealthcare team apply the theoretical concepts and constructs \nintroduced by developmental theorists, especially the theo\u00ad\nries of Erikson, Piaget, and Freud. From birth through the \nvarious developmental stages, application of these theories \nallows providers to assess what is considered expected at an \ninfant\u2019s particular stage, and provide anticipatory guidance \nto parents about what is coming next for the infant.\nErik Erikson\u2019s Theory of Psychosocial Development\nErikson described trust versus mistrust as the challenge for the \ninfant during the first year of life. If the infant fails to develop \na sense of trust in the environment and care providers, the \ninfant will demonstrate signs of mistrust (frustration and \nanxiety). Consistently providing for an infant\u2019s basic needs, \nsuch as warmth, feedings, dry diapers, holding/cuddling, \nsensory exploration, and consistent caregiving, gives the \ninfant the sense of security needed to develop trust.\nJean Piaget\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Development\nPiaget describes the period of infancy up to the second \nbirthday as the sensorimotor stage. During this stage, the \ninfant uses his or her senses to explore the environment and \nobjects. The infant develops more coordinated movements \nthat allow for object manipulation and exploration. The \nrecognition of object permanence emerges, such that the \ninfant searches for items taken out of sight. Differentiation \nof self from environment is established.\nSigmund Freud\u2019s Theory of Psychosexual Development\nAccording to Freud, infancy is the oral phase, in which the \nprimary focus of exploration and sensation is the mouth. \nInfants, when developmentally able, will place all items in \ntheir mouth to explore and learn. Freud describes how sucking \nand biting are the primary sources of pleasure at this time.\n\t\nDevelopmental Theory\t\n75\n", "Expected Growth and Development: \nInfant\nThe period of infancy is marked by rapid growth and develop\u00ad\nment. The neonate quickly moves from complete dependency \nand motor movements based on primitive reflexes to rapidly \ndeveloping gross and fine motor control. Infants experience \na growth pattern that is described as cephalocaudal (from \nthe head downward) and proximal\u2013distal (from the center \npoint outward). Figure 6-6 illustrates this growth pattern. \nThe pediatric nurse can expect the infant to demonstrate \na series of milestones in the following order (Table 6-1):\nFigure 6-6\u2002 Infants experience a cephalocaudal and proximal\u2013distal \ngrowth pattern.\nProximal\u2013distal\nMidline of body\noutward to extremities\nCephalocaudal\nFrom head\ndown to feet\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nAnticipatory Guidance for Family with a Neonate: \nThermoregulation\nProviding warmth to a newborn is a very important task for \nnew parents.

The following \nsubstances are most commonly implicated in infant and \nyoung-child poisonings (National Capital Poison Center, 2014):\n\u2022\t Cosmetics\n\u2022\t Cleaners\n\u2022\t Pain medications\n\u2022\t Foreign bodies\n\u2022\t Topical medications\n\u2022\t Vitamins and antihistamines\n\u2022\t Batteries\n\u2022\t Plants and mushrooms\n\u2022\t Office supplies, and arts and craft supplies\n\u2022\t Pesticides\nWorldwide, acute poisoning is the fourth most common \ncause of unintentional deaths, after traffic injuries, fires, and \ndrownings (World Health Organization, 2014). \nFigure 6-11\u2002 Common areas for poisoning.\n\u00a9 Ksenia Lev/Shutterstock\nSafety Concerns During Infancy\nInfants are inherently dependent on others to provide all \naspects of safety. As infants learn to control their move\u00ad\nments, become mobile through crawling, and then develop \nthe ability to stand, cruise while holding onto a surface, \nand walk, they become a greater safety risk with each \npassing month. Even their sleeping environment requires \nconsiderable thought to ensure safety: Parental co-sleeping, \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\u2002\nTreating Colic\nColic is a nonpathologic condition in which an infant cries \nfor more than 3 hours per day for more than 3 days per week. \nColic affects approximately one in six families and is the most \ncommon complaint seen by pediatricians in many parts of \nthe world. It typically starts at 2 weeks of age and goes away \nwithout treatment by 3 to 4 months of age. Although the \ninfant appears to be in gastric pain, infants with colic actu\u00ad\nally feed, grow, and thrive despite the long periods of crying.\nThe exact cause of colic is unknown, but theories of its \netiology include gas, overstimulation, development of the \nnervous system, acid reflux, and hormones causing discomfort. \nThere is no one, single cause of colic.\nFor safety, parents must be reminded to never shake their \nbaby and that it is okay to put the baby down safely in the \ncrib and take a break to take care of themselves during this \ntrying time. Having a colicky baby can be frustrating and \nexhausting, as there is no cure for this condition. Some ideas \nfor reducing the crying include taking the baby outside or \nusing a safe baby swing. Keeping calm, asking others for help, \nfinding respite, and providing safety for the infant is the best \nadvice a pediatric nurse can give (Dobson et\u00a0al., 2012; Johnson, \nCocker, & Chang, 2015; mayoclinic.org, 2014).\noverly soft sleeping surfaces and bedding, \u201cclutter\u201d in the \nbed, and the possibility of overheating are all sleep-related \nconcerns (Scheers, Woodard, & Thach, 2016; Task Force on \nSudden Death Syndrome & Moon, 2011). The first major \nsafety concern arises when an infant is able to push up \non the hands and arms and roll over, but it is followed by \nmany more. The prevention of head injuries during infancy \nis paramount. Table 6-3 outlines safety concerns for the \ninfant from birth to one year.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nAdministering Medications to Infants\n\u2022\t Double-check all medications being administered in a \nhealthcare setting (i.e., two nurses should check each \nmedication).\n\u2022\t Use the most current weight to calculate doses of \nmedications that are determined on a milligram per \nkilogram of weight basis.\n\u2022\t Do not administer medications to crying infants.\n\u2022\t Most medications administered to infants will have a \nlonger clearance time; monitor for toxic effects.\n\u2022\t Some medications require higher doses to cross the \nblood\u2013brain barrier.\n(continues)\n\t\nSafety Concerns During Infancy\t\n81\n", "TABLE 6-3\u2003\nSafety Concerns During Infancy\nSuffocation\n\u203a\u203a\nInfants will readily pull plastic bags over their head.\n\u203a\u203a\nBalloons should never be given to an infant or kept in the home environment.\n\u203a\u203a\nPlastic crib mattress covers must be removed.\n\u203a\u203a\nCrib slats must not be spaced wider than 25\u20448 inches.\n\u203a\u203a\nNo pillows, toys, or stuffed animals should be placed in a crib.\n\u203a\u203a\nStrings and drawstrings must be removed from blankets or clothing.\n\u203a\u203a\nInfants should always be placed on their back to sleep to reduce risk of suffocation and SIDS.\nAspiration and Asphyxiation\n\u203a\u203a\nSmall toys should not be given to infants.

Care of pediatric \npatients focuses on expected or normal growth and de\u00ad\nvelopment from the neonate through adolescent periods.\n\u25c6\u25c6The infant developmental stage is marked by rapid growth \nin height, weight, head circumference, and body mass index. \nInfants are typically expected to double their birth weight \nby 6 months of age and triple their birth weight by 1 year. \nHeight typically increases by 50% from birth to 1 year of age.\n\u25c6\u25c6The infant developmental stage is divided into three \ndistinct periods: the neonatal period (birth to 28 days), \nthe young infancy period (1 month to 6 months), and \nthe older infancy period (6 months to 1 year). Each \ntime frame has unique cognitive and motor milestones.\n\u25c6\u25c6Neonates experience the highest rate of mortality of all \npediatric age cohorts. The majority of neonates who die \ndo so in the first 72 hours; this outcome may be due to \ncongenital anomalies, complications of birth, compli\u00ad\ncations of prematurity, or a life-threatening condition.\n\u25c6\u25c6The transition from the uterus to the environment requires \nthe infant to establish and maintain a breathing pattern.\n\u25c6\u25c6In terms of their development, infants are described as \nbeing in Erikson\u2019s trust versus mistrust stage, Piaget\u2019s \nsensorimotor stage, and Freud\u2019s oral stage.\n\u25c6\u25c6Infants follow a unique path of motor milestones that \nprogress from holding their head up to walking within \none year. After birth, they present with primitive reflexes \n(most of which disappear by four to six months) that \nare subsequently replaced with purposive movements.\n\u25c6\u25c6Safety is an extreme concern during the infant\u2019s first year \nof life. Infants are inquisitive and will mouth everything \nthey can reach, fall easily, and are at risk for suffocation, \naspiration, poisoning, head injuries, and drowning.\n\u25c6\u25c6Pediatric nurses are in a position to offer anticipatory \nguidance to new parents about what to expect next and \nhow to plan for safety in all environments.\nBibliography\nBlumberg, M.

Toddlers learn \nto play on their own as they sense they are separate from \ntheir primary caregivers. This section presents the work \nof four theorists whose contributions to a deeper under\u00ad\nstanding of the developmental stages of childhood (i.e., to \ndevelopmental theory) can enhance the pediatric nurse\u2019s \nappreciation of toddler needs and desires.\nErik Erikson\u2019s Theory of Psychosocial Development\n\u201cAutonomy versus shame and doubt\u201d is the crisis that \ncharacterizes the toddler stage of Erik Erikson\u2019s psychoso\u00ad\ncial development theory (a theory of the development of \npersonality over the life span based on social influences and \nenvironmental factors). During this stage, toddlers struggle \nwith becoming perceptually aware of their separation from \nthe primary caregiver. Mastery over autonomy (the abil\u00ad\nity to act without another person\u2019s control or influence) \nmust occur, or otherwise subsequent feelings of shame \nand doubt (self-questioning about one\u2019s ability to handle \nproblems) will emerge. Toddlers may display frustration \nas they learn that they must wait to have their needs met \nor gratification secured.\nParents have an integral role in assisting with autonomy \nby offering opportunities for toddlers to show they \u201ccan do it\u201d \nor \u201cme do it.\u201d Parents need to be encouraging and supportive, \nyet\u00a0also provide rules, boundaries, and feedback. Children \nmust learn that their behaviors and responses will have pre\u00ad\ndictable effects on others, and they need positive feedback to \ndevelop acceptable behaviors. Egotistical thought, frequently \nsaying \u201cNO,\u201d loud protests, and tantrums all add to the spe\u00ad\ncial patience and guidance required to care for a toddler in \na positive and productive way (Muscari, 2001) (Figure 7-2).\nIntroduction\nThe toddler period includes the age range of 1 year up \nto the child\u2019s 3rd birthday. During this phase, children\u2019s \nphysical growth slows down, they master locomotion, and \nthey feel the need to express themselves as independent \nand autonomous. Sometimes labeled as the \u201cterrible twos,\u201d \nthe toddler period brings both challenges and joys. Parents \nwatch as their infant becomes a small mobile child with \ndeveloping language skills and increasingly expressive \nemotions. They also become acutely aware of how fast, \nunsafe, and in need of constant supervision their toddler \nis. Indeed, children of this age are inherently unsafe, as \nthey explore their environment using all of their senses \nand try out new motor skills that make them prone to falls \nand other potential harm. Toddlers are very curious and \npersistent in their exploration. In turn, pediatric nurses \nmust demonstrate excellent role modeling in safety while \npracticing patience and applying boundaries. Specific \nnegotiation skills can help when assisting a toddler and \nhis or her parents in navigating a healthcare encounter.\nAs toddlers grow, they demonstrate more energy, more \ncreativity, and more sophistication in their play activities. \nFine motor development of their fingers allows for greater \nmanipulation of small objects. Yet, overall, they are clumsy \nand uncoordinated, making them unsafe in many situations. \nParents are often in awe as they see their toddler move from \ncrawling to cruising along furniture to independent walking to \nrunning, all in the course of a few quick months (Figure 7-1).\nSocial considerations at this age include the child\u2019s ability \nto understand object permanence, stranger anxiety, and \nthe beginning of toilet training. If the family has another \nbaby while the previous child is a toddler, the older child \nmay display jealousy toward the new sibling or regression \nto earlier behaviors.\nFigure 7-1\u2002 As toddlers grow, they demonstrate more energy, more \ncreativity, and more sophistication in their play activities.\n\u00a9 Pikul Noorod/Shutterstock\nFigure 7-2\u2002 Tantrums can add to the patience and guidance required \nto care for a toddler in a positive and productive way.\n\u00a9 Jill Tindall/Moment/Getty\n\t\nDevelopmental Theory\t\n87\n", "FAMILY EDUCATION\nTemper Tantrums and the \u201cTerrible Twos\u201d: \nProviding Anticipatory Guidance to Parents of \nToddlers\nLimited language:\n\u2022\t Toddlers have trouble expressing their emotions, \nthoughts, and needs due to their limited language \ndevelopment.

It is a natural and easier movement to \nwipe from back to front, but this leads to wiping stool \nacross the genitalia.\nSigmund Freud\u2019s Theory of Psychosexual Development\nThe toddler stage, according to Freud, is focused on the \nsexual centers of the buttocks and the anus. This \u201canal\u201d \nstage is marked by the required mastery of retention and \nvoluntary expulsion of fecal elimination. Toileting skills \nbecome important as toddlers gain ever-increasing con\u00ad\ntrol of their neuromuscular functions. Freud\u2019s theory of \npsychosexual development focuses on the development of \nlibido fixed on specific areas of the body, which proceeds \nthrough five stages (oral, anal, phallic, latent, genital); it \nsuggests that the mastery of toileting and established con\u00ad\ntrol of eliminative behaviors gives the toddler a sense of \nmastery over \u201cletting go or holding on.\u201d Box 7-1 provides \nadditional information on toilet training a toddler.\nKohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development\nObedience, punishment, and rewards shape the toddler pe\u00ad\nriod, which Kohlberg identifies as part of the preconventional \nstage of moral development (i.e., development of a sense of \nright and wrong, and the ability to perform moral reason\u00ad\ning). As the child is egocentric\u2014without the ability to see \nothers\u2019 points of view\u2014negativity develops toward actions \nthat produce punishment. Caregivers must apply consistent \nrules and consequences when dealing with toddlers, who \nmay not understand the connection between their actions \nand the discipline. Time-outs are effective if kept short and \naccompanied by a quick, developmentally appropriate expla\u00ad\nnation as to why the time-out is occurring (Muscari, 2001).\nJean Piaget\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Development\nPiaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development (i.e., development \nof the ability to think and reason) describes the toddler \nperiod as being marked by sensorimotor exploration and \n88\t\nChapter 7\u2003 Caring for Toddlers\n", "Communication\nLanguage development occurs rapidly in the toddler \n\u00adperiod. The toddler begins the second year with only 1 to \n2 words, but ends the toddler period at the third birthday \nwith between 300 and 500 words. Typically, the toddler \nuses 2- to 3-word sentences, learns to use pronouns, and \nstates his or her first and last names by approximately \n2\u00bd\u00a0years of age.\nMultilingual families typically provide rich cultural \nexperiences, but may create some challenges in language \ndevelopment. Residence in a household where two lan\u00ad\nguages are spoken has been known to cause small delays \nin toddler language development.

The toddler, in contrast, experiences slower \ngrowth through what are known as \u201cspurts and lags.\u201d The \ntoddler gains only 1.8 to 2.72 kg (4\u20126 lb) in weight per \nyear, the head circumference expands by just 1.25 to 2.5 \ncm (0.5\u20131 in) per year, and height increases by only 7.5 cm \n(3\u00a0in) per year, or less. Most experts agree that the weight of \na toddler who is 2\u00bd years of age should be approximately \n4\u00a0times (quadruple) the birth weight. Toddlers should con\u00ad\ntinue to have their head circumferences measured at each \nwell-child check-up to ensure expected head growth and \nconfirm closure of the anterior fontanel. Notably, injuries or \nconditions of the brain tissue and cerebral spinal fluid can \naffect this measurement.

Risk factors for lead poisoning include low \nhousehold income, living in an older home or neighborhood \nwhere exposure can come from flaking lead paint or lead-lined \nwater intake pipes, and contact with contaminated soil. The \npresence of items imported from countries where use of lead \nis not regulated, such as toys, cosmetics, ceramics, jewelry, and \nother products, also can contribute to toxicity. In addition, a \nvariety of folk remedies are known to be contaminated with \nlead. Symptoms of lead poisoning can include gastrointesti\u00ad\nnal problems, decreased height, delayed sexual maturation, \nincreased tooth caries (breakdown of the teeth because of \nbacterial actions), and impaired neurologic development (e.g., \nbehavioral changes, mental impairment, seizures).\nIron-deficiency anemia and lead poisoning are sometimes \nrelated, as iron-deficient children are at higher risk of lead toxicity \nshould exposure occur (Warniment, Tsang, & Galazka, 2010).\n\t\nHealth Concerns for the Toddler\t\n91\n", "Figure 7-4\u2002 Vastus lateralis.\nVastus lateralis\n(outer middle third)\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nTherapeutic Holds for Toddlers Undergoing \nProcedures\nHave all equipment set up and ready to go!\n\u2022\t Ear assessment: Seat the child in the parent\u2019s lap.

Two staff members and one parent may be \nrequired to perform this sterile technique on a toddler.\nRespiratory Concerns\nAs toddlers become more social and begin to attend pre\u00ad\nschool or other childcare environments, their exposure \nto infectious diseases increases. Toddlers may experience \ncolds and other viral infections that lead to respiratory \nsymptoms. A toddler with respiratory distress, such as \nthe distress that can occur with the highly communicable \nrespiratory syncytial virus, can present with loud adven\u00ad\ntitious breath sounds, persistent coughing, and mucus \nproduction. Toddlers should be evaluated for supportive \ncare if distress is present.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nA \ntoddler who presents with adventitious breath sounds \nshould be immediately evaluated for respiratory distress. \nDistress can be associated with foreign objects in the airway, \nbronchiolitis, reactive airway disease, or asthma.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nImmunizations\nDuring the toddler period, a child should receive the fol\u00ad\nlowing immunizations:\n1.\t DTaP: Administered IM, this vaccine covers three \n\u00adbacterial infections\u2014diphtheria, tetanus, and \n\u00adpertussis.

Even autism \nspectrum disorders (ASDs) now have screening tools \nfor children in the 18- to 24-month age bracket. The \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics recommends that \u201call \nchildren be screened with an ASD-specific instrument \nduring well-child visits at ages 18 and 24 months in con\u00ad\njunction with ongoing developmental surveillance and \nbroadband developmental screening\u201d (Zwaigenbaum \net\u00a0al., 2015).\nNevertheless, identifying \u201cproblem\u201d behaviors in \ntoddlers is difficult. At this stage, many behaviors that \nmight seem to suggest \u201csomething is wrong\u201d are actually \nshort-term conditions rather than long-lasting issues. A \nchild\u2019s development is so rapid during the toddler phase \nthat it complicates potential diagnosis; behaviors that \nare concerning in a slightly older child may be perfectly \nnormal in a toddler. As Gardner and Shaw (2008) point \nout, \u201csix temper tantrums a day might be bothersome \nbut normal at 22 months, but could contribute to a \ndiagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in a \n4-year-old.\u201d This makes using a toddler\u2019s behavior to \nassess for the presence of behavioral disorders difficult \nfor clinicians.\nNevertheless, recent research has shown that as \nmany as 55% of children with early behavioral problems \ndo not spontaneously outgrow their issues (Bagner, \n\u00adRodr\u00edguez, Blake, Linares, & Carter, 2012), which makes \nearly identification of children with true emotional or \nbehavioral disturbances important. Many discussions \nabout assessment of toddler behavior (e.g., Reynolds, \n2010) focus on the need for clinicians to perform an \nassessment based on multiple sources of information, \nincluding the child\u2019s observable behavior, the parent\u2013\nchild interaction, and the child\u2019s self-perception (using \nan age-appropriate method).\nSafety Concerns for the Toddler\nToddlers are inherently unsafe. They are very active, love \nto explore their environments, want to test boundaries, \nand will test limits often. Providing safe environments at \npreschool, home, outside play areas, and healthcare settings \nis imperative (Box 7-2; Figure 7-6). Safety sweeps should \nbe conducted often to make sure there are no potential \nscenarios where injuries, falls, or drowning might take \nSkin Issues\nToddlers are learning to be toilet trained and, therefore, \nare still in diapers. Frequent diaper changes are needed \nto prevent skin breakdown and contact dermatitis. Tod\u00ad\ndlers should wear a sunscreen with a high sun protection \nfactor (SPF) and a hat whenever they are playing outside \n(Figure 7-5). Any rash found on a toddler should be as\u00ad\nsessed for the presence of a communicable disease such \nas varicella, measles, or rubeola.\nGastrointestinal Health\nToddlers can be prone to constipation; to avoid this prob\u00ad\nlem, their diet should include a variety of high-fiber foods. \nThe introduction of fruits daily and vegetables with every \nlunch and dinner is an educational point that the nurse \nshould discuss with the family.

Administering medications safely is also a \nmajor concern. Box 7-3 provides tips on safe medication \nadministration for children in this developmental stage.\nBEST PRACTICES\nB\necause toddlers are notorious for taking off their identifica\u00ad\ntion tags/bands, it is important that the pediatric healthcare \nteam perform safety \u201ctime-outs\u201d prior to any medication \nadministration or procedure. Parents should confirm the \ntoddler\u2019s full name, spelling, and date of birth.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nToddlers in a Hospital Crib\nToddlers should not be placed in a regular twin-sized bed un\u00ad\nless institutional policy and practice allows for this possibility \nwhen the parents are always present. Instead, a toddler should \nbe placed in a safe, metal, high-top crib so that there is no \nchance that the child will experience a fall by climbing over \nthe crib rails. Even at a young age, children will stack objects \nleft in their bed and use them to provide the boost needed \nto climb out of a crib.\nWhenever a pediatric healthcare provider, or parent, has \nlowered the crib rails, they should put them up safely when \ndone and then double-check that the rail lock is secure. A \ntoddler can experience a significant injury if the rail is not \nhooked and the child leans on it, causing the rail to fall rapidly.\nMake sure the toddler does not have access to wires, \npumps, or medical devices by reaching the arms through \nthe rail. Toddler cribs should not be close to oxygen delivery \ndevices, electrical outlets, or suction devices. Try to arrange \nthe location of the crib in full view from the open door.\nTemperament of the Toddler\nCaring for a toddler has its own joys and challenges. Each \nchild is unique: He or she comes from a unique family \nbackground, culture, and childrearing practice, and has \na unique temperament (the dominant disposition of an \nindividual\u2014an aspect of personality). Some toddlers are \nmore easygoing; others have a difficult time with change. \nSome toddlers are loud and rowdy; others are quieter and \nmore contemplative. Most toddlers throw tantrums and \ncreate battles over items or situations where they want \nto exert control. Some, faced with the introduction of an \ninfant sibling, may temporarily regress to behaviors ap\u00ad\npropriate to younger children or display other behaviors \n(sleep disturbance, aggression) in response to the change \nof their status (Volling, 2012). This behavior is to be ex\u00ad\npected during this developmental stage. Parents need to \nbe reassured that setting boundaries and limits, ignoring \ntantrums when safe to do so, and being patient during this \ntime of growing \u201cautonomy\u201d are important.\n\t\nTemperament of the Toddler\t\n95\n", "Case Study\nKevin, a 19-month-old toddler, has been hospitalized for facial \ncellulitis requiring 5 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy via a \nperipheral saline lock line.

She stated \nthat she would call to check on her toddler throughout the \ntime she would be away, but that realistically she would not \nbe back to see Kevin until late in the afternoon the next day. \nAs Karen held and kissed Kevin, she told him she was leaving, \nbecame tearful, and placed him back into the high-top crib. \nKevin immediately became very distressed, crying loudly and \nbanging his head on the bars of the crib.

In this stage, the child \nattempts new skills, tries out new relationships, and par\u00ad\nticipates in new activities (initiative) (Figure 8-2). If dis\u00ad\ncouraged or unsuccessful in these attempts, the child may \ndevelop a sense of self-doubt and guilt. Without mastery \nof this phase, the preschool-age child will not continue to \ndemonstrate a sense of exploration, initiation, and desire \nfor mastery of new experiences.\nPreschoolers are learning how assertiveness and \npurposeful actions influence their environment. As they \nprogress, they evaluate their own behavior and notice \nthe behavior of others. This process helps to guide the \ndevelopment of conscience. If the child initiates actions \nthat are met with parental disapproval, the child may \ndevelop further guilt.\nSigmund Freud\u2019s Theory of Psychosexual Development\nAccording to Freud\u2019s theory, the preschool-age child is \nin the phallic-locomotion phase. In this stage, the child \nrecognizes differences in the genders and shows an inter\u00ad\nest in discovery and understanding of the genital area. \nFreud\u2019s theory introduces four distinct experiences for \nthe preschool-age child: penis envy, the Oedipus com\u00ad\nplex, the Electra complex, and castration anxiety (also \nreferred to as genital mutilation anxiety). According to \nFreud\u2019s concept of the Electra complex, a preschool-age \nfemale child feels a psychosexual competition with the \nchild\u2019s mother or significant female figure over her father. \nIn opposition, the male child experiences the Oedipus \ncomplex as competition with his father figure over his \nmother.\nIntroduction\nThe preschool period includes the age range of 3 years \nthrough the end of the child\u2019s 5th year. During this \nphase, the preschooler\u2019s growth continues to be slow \nand steady. Although growth refers to an increase in \nphysical size, development refers to an increase in skill \nand an increase in complexity of demonstrated tasks. \nThe preschooler\u2019s development is characterized by an \nincreasing ability to show more complexity in movement, \ncognitive processing, language, and fine motor abilities. \nThe preschool period is also marked by participation in \nmagical thinking\u2014the idea that merely thinking about \nor wishing an interaction, person, or event will cause it \nto occur. Magical thinking in an older child or adult is \nconsidered irrational; however, for children in this stage \nof development, it is normal.\nAs preschool-age children grow, they demonstrate \nmore graceful and coordinated movements. Fine motor \ndevelopment of their fingers continues, which allows for \ngreater manipulation and progressive success in the use of \nwriting utensils, art supplies, crafting skills, and toys that \nrequire more fine manipulation (Figure 8-1). Emotionally, \npreschool-age children have fewer tantrums and greater \nability to express themselves verbally and negotiate.\nDevelopmental Theory\nThe preschool period features many different transi\u00ad\ntions and changes. This section presents the work of four \ntheorists whose contributions to a deeper understanding \nof the developmental stages of childhood can enhance \nthe pediatric nurse\u2019s appreciation of the child\u2019s changing \nbehaviors, needs, and desires.\nFigure 8-1\u2002 During the preschool period, fine motor development \ncontinues, allowing for greater manipulation.\n\u00a9 FatCamera/E+/Getty \nFigure 8-2\u2002 According to Erikson, the preschool period is character\u00ad\nized by initiative.\n\u00a9 Blend Images - KidStock/Brand X Pictures/Getty\n\t\nDevelopmental Theory\t\n99\n", "Lawrence Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development\nAfter beginning as a developmental psychologist, Kohlberg, \na Harvard University professor, moved into the field of moral \neducation. His well-known theory of moral development \nwas based on Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget\u2019s work. Both \nKohlberg and Piaget believed that a person develops in a \nprogressive pattern, including a progressive development of \nmoral reasoning. Kohlberg describes a child at the preschool \nlevel as preconventional, signifying that the child\u2019s moral \nthinking and behavior are based on concepts related to \nobedience and punishment (Kohlberg & Hersh, 1977). In \nthis developmental stage, the child learns socially accept\u00ad\nable \u201cnormal\u201d behavior by being compelled by the threat of \npunishment and rewarded by social obedience. Included in \nKohlberg\u2019s theory is the notion that a child does not \u201cjump\u201d \nstages of moral reasoning, but rather progresses stage by \nstage through various experiences and levels (Barger, 2000).\nJean Piaget\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Development\nPiaget describes the preschool period as one marked by \npreconceptual thought (inability to distinguish members \nof the same class). In this developmental stage, the child \ncontinues to use egocentric approaches to address the \ndemands made by both society and the environment. \nAccording to Piaget, the preschool-age child participates \nin intuitive thinking, in which the child centers his or her \nthinking on one characteristic of something and then \nforms a judgment or makes a decision based on that single \ncharacteristic. This phase in early preschool includes the \negocentric perspective that the world revolves around \u201cme,\u201d \nbut during this phase, their thoughts begin to include others.\nThis stage can be also be defined based on the young \nchild\u2019s judgment of self or the environment through visual \nexperiences. Young children thoroughly enjoy exploring \ntheir environments and rapidly develop language that allows \nthem to describe their world and experiences to others, \nalbeit not always truthfully, in great detail. The preschooler \nalso learns to understand cause and effect.\nToward the middle of the preschool developmental stage, \nthe egocentric thought process diminishes and children \nbegin to include others\u2019 ideas and preferences into their \nthinking. Throughout this phase, children express their \nexperiences in words, even if their thoughts are not based \ncompletely on reality.\nExpected Growth and Development: \nPreschooler\nDuring the preschool period, children experience slow \nand steady growth. \u201cSpurts and lulls\u201d in growth are still \ncommon, but overall growth in height, weight, and head \ncircumference is slow and steady. The preschooler gains only \n2.27 kg (5 lb) per year and increases in height by 7 cm (less \nthan 3 in) per year. Average height for preschoolers is 97.5 \nto 112.5 cm (39\u201245 in) and average weight is 15.9 to 20.5 \nkg (35\u201245 lb). Development milestones for preschoolers \nare shown in Table 8-1 (Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention [CDC], 2014).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nMasturbation\nPreschoolers often explore their bodies and find pleasure \nand comfort in touching their genitals. Masturbation at this \nlevel does not produce orgasm, but rather is a comforting \nand pleasurable experience during this developmental stage. \nMasturbation is normal and is practiced by all sexes. Many \npreschoolers use masturbation as a form of soothing. Parents \nmay need anticipatory guidance in this behavior. Parents \nshould be told that there is no relationship with early child\u00ad\nhood masturbation and sexual activity, sexual deviance, or \nany physical or emotional harm. According to McGrath (2008), \nmasturbation does not mean the child has experienced sexual \nabuse. If the parents are concerned, or the behavior is done \nin public, the child should be distracted or encouraged to \ngo to his or her room.\nBEST PRACTICES\nPain in the Preschool Period\nThe experience of discomfort or pain for the preschool-age \nchild is very frightening. Because of their limited language \ncapacity, imagination, and magical thinking, these children \nare at risk for not expressing their pain location, intensity, and \ntemporal factor clearly or accurately. A cognitively intact young \npreschooler (as young as 3 years of age) may be able to use the \nWong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, but not all preschoolers \nthis age will be able to do so. The pediatric nurse should use \nsubjective scales such as the FACES Scale and an objective tool \nsuch as the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) \nScale, along with physiological measurements such as vital \nsigns, to accurately determine the child\u2019s pain experience. A \nyoung child may lay a hand on the tummy and say the chest \nhurts, or may put hands on the ears and say the head hurts. \nNurses can be confident that where the child\u2019s hands are \nplaced is the location of the pain experience. \nParents\u2019 responses to the child\u2019s pain can be important in \nreducing or enhancing the child\u2019s experience of pain.

Who is your favorite person to dress up as? What \ndo you like to do when you dress up?\npreschool-age children (Canadian Paediatric Society, 2004; \nDosman & Andrews, 2012). Parents should be guided to \navoid disciplining preschoolers using physical or corpo\u00ad\nral punishment, as these strategies have been associated \nwith negative long-term behavioral patterns (MacKenzie, \nNicklas, Waldfogel, & Brooks-Gunn, 2012).\nPlay Needs of the Preschooler\nPreschoolers enjoy moving from the toddler style of play \ncalled parallel play to activities that are more interactive \nwith their peers. Most preschoolers enjoy associative \nplay, which includes loose rules, creativity, and pretend \nor dramatic play. Associative play typically starts as spon\u00ad\ntaneous with little preparation, thought, organization, or \nrole delineation.\nPreschoolers enjoy imitating adults and will have fun \ndressing up as adult-type characters such as a nurse, police \nofficer, fire fighter, construction worker, dentist, doctor, \nbusiness person, ballerina, and characters from movies \n(e.g., Disney films). They also enjoy using \u201cplay\u201d or toy \nreplicas of adult items, such as toy cash registers, toy medi\u00ad\ncal equipment, play computers, and play structures such \nas kitchens, schoolrooms, and toolkits. Some children \nenjoy the development of an imaginary friend and will \ndemonstrate intense conversations and interactions with \ntheir \u201cfriend.\u201d Parents need anticipatory guidance that this \nbehavior is normal throughout the preschool period and \ndoes not represent any pathology or concerns.\nPreschoolers also participate in symbolic functioning, \nin which they are able to take an item and turn it into an \nobject of their reality. For instance, preschoolers\u2019 imagina\u00ad\ntions might lead them to make a king\u2019s crown out of a paper \nplate, use a towel to dress up in a royal cape, use a cardboard \nbox as a race car, or create a classroom by setting up dolls \nand stuffed animals arranged as an audience (Figure 8-3).\nCommunication and Discipline\nLanguage development flourishes during the preschool \nperiod. A typical 3-year-old will have, on average, 300 to \n900 words; a 4-year-old will have 1,000 to 1,500 words; \nand a 5-year-old\u2019s vocabulary will increase to 1,500 to \n2,100 words.\nDuring this phase of development, children become \ncapable of distinguishing reality from imagination and \nknowing limitations. Because they have not fully devel\u00ad\noped their sense of cause and effect, however, discipline \nfor misbehavior needs to take into account what the child \nis and is not able to comprehend. Realistic expectations \nand positive, behavior-focused practices (time-outs, \nrewards and approval, and praise, but not lectures or \ndenial of play, food, or affection) that are applied con\u00ad\nsistently by all caregivers are important in disciplining \nTABLE 8-1\u2003\nPreschool Development (continued\u2009)\n102\t\nChapter 8\u2003 Caring for Preschoolers\n", "access preventive medical care (Kim & Kaste, 2013).

Anticipatory guidance for parents includes \nthe importance and impact of preventive dental care for \nprimary teeth, the essential role of fluoride, and the effects \nof feeding practices on dental health (Chhabra & Chhabra, \n2012). Nurses should also inquire whether families have \naccess to dental care (Askelson et\u00a0al., 2013) and whether a \nfamily\u2019s primary drinking water source is fluoridated.\nHealth Concerns for the Preschooler\nNutrition\nMany parents who are concerned about their preschool-age \nchild\u2019s \u201cpicky eating\u201d or refusal to eat are simply unaware that \ntheir child\u2019s eating habits are normal (Leung, Marchand, & \nSuave, 2012).

Preschoolers are far more verbal than toddlers, but \nare not necessarily safer. Parents, preschool teachers, babysitters, \nand other guardians must know what a preschooler is doing \nat all times and often should provide direct supervision during \nplay. Because of their desire to imitate adults, preschoolers may \nseek out equipment, cleaning solutions, buckets of water, and \nother items whose use requires preventive precautions, direct \napproval, and supervision. A preschooler\u2019s environment should \ncontinue to be kept safe by using cabinet locks, keeping the \nkitchen and stove/oven safe, supervising outdoor play, and \npreventing bathroom play.\nWeisman, 2007). The pediatric nurse should allow the child \nto touch, handle, and play with medical equipment if safe, \nand all procedures should be explained immediately prior \nto the process (e.g., otoscope use, blood pressure checks, \nlab draws, immunizations and physical assessments) \n(Figure 8-5).

If they do not \nmaster these feelings, children in this stage may develop \na sense of inferiority, judging their performance against \nothers\u2019 accomplishments and successes. The transition from \npreschool to elementary and middle school launches the \nchild into a world of academic demands, recreational and \nsports activities, increasing household chore responsibili\u00ad\nties, and expanding social encounters.\nIntroduction\nThe school-age developmental period, which extends over \n7 years, is the longest of the five developmental stages for \nchildren. This stage starts when the child enters kindergarten \n(usually age 5\u00bd or 6) and lasts until age 13. Because of the \ndiversity in maturation, this developmental period can be \nconceptualized as consisting of two distinct segments: (1) \nthe early school-age period, in which the child is leaving the \npreschool developmental stage marked with dependence \nand magical thinking, and (2) the later school-age period, \nas the child begins to enter prepubescence.\nParents describe the shift from the preschool stage to \nthe school-age stage as very powerful, as children begin to \nrelate to their peers as much as or more than they relate to \nthe family, and they spend more time away from the family \nas their social life and extracurricular activities expand and \ngrow (Figure 9-1). The parenting role changes as the child \ndemonstrates increased independence. Many describe this \nstage as the \u201ceasiest\u201d in parenting, as children are mastering \nindependent tasks and becoming accomplished in social \nexpansion, academic work, and self-care. The school-age \nchild even looks different than in previous stages, losing the \n\u201cbaby face\u201d and growing taller and leaner with increasing \ncoordination and independence in tasks. Many describe \nyoung school-age children (ages 6 to 10) as sweet; cooperative; \neager to please parents, teachers, and others in authority such \nas coaches; and easy to be around (Figure 9-2). Similarly, \nmany teachers describe children in the school-age stage \nas being more compliant with academic responsibilities \nincluding homework assignments and classroom activities.\nDevelopmental Theory\nThe work of four theorists contributes to a deeper under\u00ad\nstanding of the developmental stages of childhood, enhances \nFigure 9-1\u2002 The social life and extracurricular activities of school-age \nchildren expand and grow.\n\u00a9 FatCamera/E+/Getty\nFigure 9-2\u2002 Many describe young school-age children as easy to \nbe around.\n\u00a9 Lisa F. Young/Shutterstock\nBEST PRACTICES\nNurses\u2019 Influence on Children\u2019s Feelings of Industry\nBy understanding the school-age child\u2019s need for a sense of \naccomplishment, engagement, and industry, the pediatric \nnurse interacting with a school-age child in a healthcare \nsetting can more effectively identify opportunities to sup\u00ad\nport the developmental tasks associated with this stage \nof development. Asking school-age children about their \nschooling, teachers, principal, and peers may open the door \nfor personal disclosure. School-age children enjoy talking \nabout their work and their current projects. While in the \nhealthcare setting, the pediatric nurse can ask for \u201chelp\u201d from \nthe child through projects such as organizing pamphlets, \ndrawing maps of the healthcare setting including where the \nfire extinguishers are located, or determining how many fire \ndoors are present on the nursing unit.\n\t\nDevelopmental Theory\t\n109\n", "Figure 9-3\u2002 The school-age child gives minimal attention to bodily \ndetails and greater attention to activities, hobbies, socialization, and \nschoolwork.\n\u00a9 Ariel Skelley/Blend Images/Getty\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nSchool-Age Children and Bullying or Cyberbullying\nThe school-age period is a time when a child can experience \nthe negative consequences of bullying. Even minor bully\u00ad\ning, such as teasing, can have serious consequences for a \nchild\u2019s sense of well-being, self-esteem, and self-concept \n(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). Adults \nmust develop and enforce strong anti-bullying policies in \nclassrooms and playgrounds, sports activities, after-school \nprograms, and organizations such as Scouts. Cyberbullying \nis the latest form of bullying, in which the child is taunted, \nthreatened, belittled, or teased via an electronic device. \nCyberbullying behaviors can occur via social media, email, \nblogging, chat rooms, instant messaging, and texting; they \naffect between 20% and 40% of all children and adolescents \n(Aboujaoude, Savage, Starcevic, & Salame, 2015). According \nto the American Society for the Positive Care of Children \n(2011), bullying without resolution can lead to anxiety and \ndepression. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC, 2014) on bullying show the gravity of the \nproblem:\n\u2022\t More students are bullied in person than are \ncyberbullied.\n\u2022\t Verbal bullying is the most prevalent form of bullying.\n\u2022\t Bullying leads to school absences due to safety \nconcerns.\n\u2022\t Psychosomatic manifestations of the stress from be\u00ad\ning bullied include chronic headaches, stomachaches, \nand anorexia.\n\u2022\t Bullying is highly related to a child\u2019s state of over\u00ad\nweight or obesity.\n\u2022\t Youth with disabilities are often singled out for \nbullying.\n\u2022\t Youth identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are at \nincreased risk of bullying.\nSigmund Freud\u2019s Theory of Psychosexual Development\nFreud\u2019s theory focuses on the school-age child\u2019s developing \nsexuality and maturity. During this phase of development, \nchildren are learning to adapt to their school community \nand academic demands as well as determining their place \nin the family structure and social structure of peers. The \nterm sexual latency is applied to this developmental phase \nto indicate the child\u2019s minimal attention to bodily details \nand greater attention to activities, hobbies, socialization, \nand schoolwork (Figure 9-3). Thus, parents of school-age \nchildren may find themselves having to remind children \nabout hygiene, dental care, and other self-care practices, \neven if the child has mastered independent practice of \nthese activities in the prior stage of development.\nLawrence Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development\nMoral development during the school-age period centers on \nthe development of and respect for rules, order, and expecta\u00ad\ntions. Those outside of the child are most influential in the \ndevelopment of the child\u2019s expectations of right and wrong, \nrather than the child\u2019s intrinsic self. Both feelings of guilt and \nfear of discipline or loss of privileges influence the child\u2019s \nbehavior. Hockenberry and Wilson (2013) describe how \nthe younger school-age child sometimes associates injuries, \naccidents, and unfortunate events with punishment. Older \nschool-age children, by comparison, judge their behaviors \nand the outcomes of their behaviors as intentional\u2014a \nperception that allows for the child to begin processing \nconsequences prior to engaging in the act or behavior.\nKohlberg describes the school-age child as being in \nstage 2\u2014a stage characterized by the early emergence of \nmoral reciprocity, in which children believe that if they do \nwhat is right, they will receive good back, and if they make \nothers happy, happiness will come back to them (Snarey\u00a0& \nSamuelson, 2014). Nevertheless, school-age children will \nmentally process their desire to apply rules and order thinking \ndepending on whether abiding by the rules will benefit them.\nJean Piaget\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Development\nPiaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development describes the \nschool-age period as the stage of concrete operations. Logi\u00ad\ncal thinking and basic inductive reasoning about the world \nand life\u2019s events guide the child in processing information \nand developing thinking strategies. Abstract thinking (i.e., \nthinking in terms of concepts and general principles), \naccording to Piaget, is not yet available to a child in this \nstage\u2014although later researchers have disagreed with this \nconclusion (Keenan, Evans, & Crowley, 2016)\u2014so children \nmay misinterpret metaphorical phrases or analogies by taking \n110\t\nChapter 9\u2003 Caring for School-Age Children\n", "Expected Growth and Development\nThe developmental period of the school-age child is \nmarked by slow and steady growth. This phase spans the \nlongest portion of childhood, and the school-age child\u2019s \nphysical, emotional, and cognitive maturity undergoes \nconsiderable changes during these years.

At the same time, school-age children \nare no longer limited to the types of magical, unstructured \nthinking seen in preschoolers, and they have better ability \nto access memory and develop strategies for remembering \nthings. Their concepts of identity and physical properties \nof objects are stable, and they are capable of understanding \ncause-and-effect relationships. By this time, they have also \nexpanded their worldview by moving away from egocen\u00ad\ntrism, and have developed an understanding that other \npeople may have different points of view from their own.\nTABLE 9-1\u2003\nSchool-Age Development\nPhysical \ngrowth and \ndevelopment\n\u203a\u203a\nGrows taller and stronger and looks leaner\n\u203a\u203a\nMuscle tissues replace preschool fat tissues, which changes the ratio of muscle to fat\n\u203a\u203a\nAble to participate in increasing activities with physical demands\n\u203a\u203a\nBecomes more coordinated in both fine and gross motor activities\n\u203a\u203a\nLung function expands, which allows for higher levels of rigorous physical activity without fatigue\n\u203a\u203a\nOverall growth is slower than in earlier developmental stages but remains steady\n\u203a\u203a\nAverage height increase for girls and boys is 3.75\u20135 cm (1.5\u20132 in) per year\n\u203a\u203a\nAverage weight increase for girls and boys is 2\u20133 kg (4\u20136.5 lb) per year\n\u203a\u203a\nIn girls, initial signs of puberty (e.g., breast buds) may start at approximately 10 years;

Knowing that variations exist, and that it is normal to \nbe taller or shorter than their peers, can be comforting for \nchildren. Explaining growth charts while discussing normal \nand expected variations between peers can be emotionally \nhelpful to an older school-age child.\nFigure 9-4\u2002 Older school-age children can demonstrate wide \nvariety in weight and height.\n\u00a9 Valeriy Lebedev/Shutterstock\nTABLE 9-1\u2003\nSchool-Age Development (continued\u2009)\n112\t\nChapter 9\u2003 Caring for School-Age Children\n", "suicides, bullying, elements of poverty and homelessness, \nand other social problems.\nThe classroom structure can also influence a school-age \nchild\u2019s social and emotional state. Pro-social behaviors \nmust be encouraged at home and in the classroom, where \ndemonstrated kindness, empathy, acceptance, acknowl\u00ad\nedgment, and respect for diversity can flourish. It is not \nuncommon for children in later-elementary classrooms \nto develop social hierarchies where a child is \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d \nof a social network. Teasing or bullying can develop if the \nchild is deemed different, weaker, or of lower social stature. \nIt is imperative that adults develop anti-bullying protocols \nand procedures to prevent bullying from occurring or \nescalating. In particular, instituting school-wide positive \nbehavioral interventions and support systems has been \nfound to be effective in reducing behavioral problems \n(Bradshaw, Waasdorp, & Leaf, 2012). Supervision for \nplayground and after-school activities should continue \non school grounds throughout this developmental period \n(Figure 9-5).\nThe end of the school-age period is marked by a spe\u00ad\ncific growth experience called prepubescence. During \nthis phase of development, children of all sexes develop \nsecondary sex characteristics over a period typically \n\u00adspanning 2 years, although girls usually undergo this tran\u00ad\nsition earlier than boys. Specifically, due to the secretion \nof estrogen and testosterone, pubertal changes\u2014that is, \nbreast tissue development and menstruation in girls; facial \nhair, penile growth, testicular growth, and deepening of \nthe voice in boys; and development of body odor, body \nhair, and acne in all sexes\u2014occur at a rapid but expected \nrate. The end of the prepubescence period is marked by \nthe ability of the older school-age child, or early teen, \nto procreate, as capacity for fertility is the hallmark of \npuberty.\nDuring prepubescence, extreme body changes occur \nand emotional upheaval takes place owing to production \nof sex hormones within the child\u2019s body:\n\u2022\t Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) is pro\u00ad\nduced by the hypothalamus.\n\u2022\t Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing \nhormone (LH) are released in the presence of the \nGn-RH hormone.\n\u2022\t Estrogen is produced in the ovaries and testoster\u00ad\none is produced in the testicles in response to the \nsecretion of LH and FSH.\nIn the rare condition known as precocious puberty, \nprepubescence and puberty occur earlier than expected\u2014\nbefore the age of 9 for boys and before the age of 8 for girls \n(Berbero\u011flu, 2009). Children who experience precocious \npuberty should be seen by an endocrinologist to discern \nwhether some type of pathology may have produced the \ncondition. Notably, tumors, brain abnormalities, and \nhormone disorders can contribute to precocious puberty \nand should be ruled out.\nSocial and Emotional Development\nSchool-age children become more in tune with their \nfeelings and are able to express themselves emotionally \nwith more clarity and sophistication. Although young \nschool-age children may continue to have fears of new \nsituations and new people, they are beginning to dem\u00ad\nonstrate patterns of acceptance and more flexibility. \nStress may continue, however, as academic demands \nand social pressures to win acceptance by their peers \nincrease. Children need to have support in learning how \nto cope with stressors and stressful situations. School-\nage children listen keenly to adults talking around them \nand may develop concerns, fears, and stress when faced \nwith natural or human-made disasters, crime, homicides, \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nMortality Rates in School-Age Children\nAccording to the National Vital Statistics Report released by \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2016), \n5340 school-age children die annually in the United States, \nor approximately 13 out of every 100,000 children. The three \ntop causes of death in school-age children are as follows:\n1.\t Accidents and injuries\n2.\t Cancer\n3.\t Intentional self-harm, such as suicide\nFigure 9-5\u2002 Supervision for playground and after-school activities \nshould continue on school grounds throughout the school-age period.\n\u00a9 Squaredpixels/E+/Getty\n\t\nExpected Growth and Development\t\n113\n", "As the school-age child grows, more opportunities for \npeer pressure and \u201cdares\u201d arise, and responding to these \nchallenges can lead to serious consequences. Parents \nmust understand the need to provide boundaries, specify \nrestrictions, and instill confidence in the child to say \u201cno\u201d \nto pressures. Building on Piaget\u2019s work, child psychologist \nDavid Elkind suggested that older school-age children tend \nto construct \u201cpersonal fables\u201d about themselves that, in \naddition to emphasizing their personal uniqueness, offer a \nsense of invulnerability (Alberts, Elkind, & \u00adGinsberg, 2007). \nOwing to their perception of immunity from threats, experi\u00ad\nmenting with new, unsafe, even potentially life-threatening \nbehaviors may take place during this developmental stage \n(e.g., smoking, playing with firecrackers or matches).\nNurses are in the unique position of being able to provide \nsound anticipatory guidance to those adults and caregivers \nwho provide supervision and safety for school-age children. \nTeaching families about health risk behaviors for this age \ngroup is essential and should include discussion about \nviolence, tobacco, drug, alcohol, and sex prevention, as \nwell as promotion of healthy diets and increased physical \nactivity (Eaton et\u00a0al., 2012). The following list identifies \nseven topics of anticipatory guidance for nurses to discuss \nwith caregivers of school-age children:\n\u2022\t School behaviors such as being prepared with home\u00ad\nwork done, fed breakfast, well hydrated, dressed ap\u00ad\npropriately, on time, and with minimal absences\n\u2022\t Provision of healthy and safe after-school activities \nand supervision; minimizing time as a \u201clatch-key \nchild\u201d (i.e., returning home after school, but not be\u00ad\ning supervised by an adult until the parent returns \nhome from work), if possible, and walking home in \ngroups\n\u2022\t Consumption of healthy meals and snacks in \nhealthy portions; reduction of intake of low- and no-\nnutrient foods, processed foods, high-fat foods, and \nhigh-calorie foods, including fast-food items (Share \nwith families the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s \n[2016] MyPlate site at www.choosemyplate.gov.)\n\u2022\t Strict no-experimentation rules for sexual activity, \nsmoking, truancy, shoplifting, and other illegal or \nconcerning behaviors of the older school-age child\n\u2022\t Restrictions and limits on electronics, gaming, social \nmedia, and television, especially with a \u201chomework \nfirst\u201d rule for all children in the home; televisions \nand computers should be excluded from the child\u2019s \nbedroom (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016)\n\u2022\t Prevention of injuries with consistent use of (and \nparental role-modeling use of) sports safety equip\u00ad\nment, padding of knees and elbow, use of helmets, \nand use of mouth guards\n\u2022\t Consistently reinforced appropriate discipline for \nany infringement of family rules\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nA\nctivities that promote safety in school-age children include \nthe following:\n\u2022\t Car safety, including appropriate booster seat use and \nadherence to keeping limbs inside\n\u2022\t School bus safety and adherence to rules set forth by \nthe state\n\u2022\t Bicycle safety and adherence to well-fitted helmets, \nuse of lights at night and reflective clothing, and fol\u00ad\nlowing the rules of the road\n\u2022\t Playground safety, including following the rules for \nspecific play structures\n\u2022\t Gun safety and use of locks, separation of bullets from \nguns, and strict family rules about guns\n\u2022\t Water safety, swimming lessons, and compliance with \nrules against rough-housing, dunking, or swimming \nalone\n\u2022\t Fire safety, including teaching about matches, and \nsafe storage of flammable fluids, chemicals, and \nsubstances\n\u2022\t Internet safety, including supervised use of social \nmedia sites and consistent family limits on time and \nsearch sites\n\u2022\t Sun and heat safety, including using sunblock, main\u00ad\ntaining good hydration, and avoiding excessive exer\u00ad\ntion in heat\n\u2022\t Personal safety, including \u201cgood touch/bad touch\u201d \ninstruction, \u201cstranger danger,\u201d not giving out personal \ninformation, and knowing what to do when lost in \ncity or outdoor locations \nSafety Concerns for the \nSchool-Age Child\nSchool-age children spend increasing amounts of time \naway from their parents, home, and family structure. \nTheir circle of socialization is expanding, and they are in\u00ad\ncreasingly more influenced by the behavior of others\u2014far \nmore so than during the toddler and preschool devel\u00ad\nopmental periods. This time away with varying levels of \nsupervision poses safety risks.\nThe foundation of safety mindedness must be laid early \nin the school-age period. Interacting with other families, \nstrangers, sports groups, and pets (especially dogs), and \nhaving transportation provided by other adults require \nconversations about safety starting in the beginning of the \nfirst year of this expanded developmental stage. Children \nas young as 6 years old must hear consistent reinforcement \nabout street safety, fire safety, car safety, water safety, pet \nsafety, stranger safety (including online communication), \nand prevention of injuries (Morrongiello, Widdifield, \nMunroe, & Zdzieborski, 2014).\n114\t\nChapter 9\u2003 Caring for School-Age Children\n", "Health Issues Common to the \nSchool-Age Child\nIn addition to awareness of developmental stages, the \npediatric nurse must be aware of health conditions (in\u00ad\ncluding illness and injury) that are commonly seen in the \nschool-age period. Contemporary data show that many \nconcerns persistently arise in the school-age developmental \nperiod: epidemics of infectious diseases such as measles and \npertussis related to increased rates of vaccination refusal \n(Phadke, Bednarczyk, Salmon, & Omer, 2016); lice infes\u00ad\ntations; food allergies; childhood obesity rates; emotional \nhealth concerns; rapidly increasing rates of diagnosis of \nautism (Blumberg et\u00a0al., 2013), attention-deficit disorder \nand attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Polanczyk, \nFAMILY EDUCATION\nBest Practices of Discipline and Consequences \nfor School-Age Children\nThe true essence of childhood discipline is to teach what is \nright and wrong, and to reinforce the priorities of a family \nthrough appropriate and successful disciplinary actions. \nDiscipline does not equate to punishment. School-age \nchildren thrive and develop in a positive direction when \nthey have clearly set and reinforced boundaries and rules. \nHow to implement discipline is considered richly set in \ncultural and ethnic values, however, and is considered \nquite controversial. \nOverall, school-age children need to understand the \nconsequences of their behaviors, and then experience \nthose consequences on a regular and consistent basis. Disci\u00ad\npline should be fair, developmentally appropriate, consistent \nin quality (e.g., not harsh one time and mild on the next \noccasion), and should match the behavior needing change. \nFor example, if a child is found playing on social media or \nelectronic games when told not to do so, the consequence \nmay mean the loss of that privilege for a fair period of time. \nIf a child comes home late from a social activity, the child \nshould then be restricted from outside social activities \nfor a period of time. The goals of discipline are to help \nthe child learn the family\u2019s rules, keep the child safe by \nlearning what is acceptable and what is not, help the child \ndevelop self-discipline, and help the child develop a sense of \nresponsibility.\nData from Canadian Paediatric Society.

The number of children with peanut allergies\u2014a \ngrowing concern across the United States\u2014has more than \ndoubled in the last decade or so (Sicherer, Mu\u00f1oz-Furlong, \nGodbold, & Sampson, 2010). Roasting peanuts has been \nshown to increase the amounts of allergy-triggering com\u00ad\npounds in these nuts (Kopper et\u00a0al., 2005). Children with \npeanut allergies must be very careful at school not to be \nexposed to nut-based products in the classroom. Some \nschools protect children from exposure by implementing \npeanut-free classrooms and peanut-free schools.\nA peanut allergy cannot be \u201coutgrown,\u201d so children \nwith severe allergies must carry injectable intramuscular \nepinephrine at all times (such as an EpiPen Jr autoinjector). \nIf possible, a spare injector should be kept available in a \nsecure location at the school, such as a nurse\u2019s office, and a \ncomprehensive management plan for emergencies developed \n(CDC, 2013b). Emergency assistance must be called when \na reaction is suspected, even after epinephrine injection \nhas taken place, due to the risk of a biphasic reaction (or \nrecurrence of symptoms), which affects as many as 20% of \nchildren. It is imperative that pediatric nurses are confident \nin teaching children and their caregivers how to identify a \nreaction and how to administer injectable epinephrine to \nreduce the chance of a full anaphylactic reaction (which \nis characterized by laryngeal edema, bronchoconstriction, \nand hypotension).\nof childhood obesity in 2011\u20132012 was approximately \n17.7% overall among children age 6\u201311, although some \nethnic groups had higher rates; among Hispanic children, \nfor example, the prevalence of obesity for children and \nadolescents was 22.4% (CDC, 2015).\nA child is considered overweight when he or she weighs \nmore than is normal for the child\u2019s age group. Obesity, \nor extremely excessive weight, occurs in children when \ndietary intake exceeds the child\u2019s energy expenditure on \na daily basis (Canoy, 2011). Obese children run a high \nrisk of being overweight or obese as adults (CDC, 2013a). \nSeveral health concerns are directly related to childhood \nobesity, including type 2 diabetes, joint disorders, second\u00ad\nary (acquired) hypertension, high cholesterol, and sleep \napnea, in addition to stigmatization and overall lower \nself-esteem (Figure 9-7).\nPediatric nursing education for families with school-age \nchildren must include topics that increase healthful eat\u00ad\ning and overall activity (such as promoting outdoor play \nactivities) and reduce screen time. Teaching the American \nCancer Society\u2019s (2016) recommendation of five to nine \nservings of fruits and vegetables per day, portion control, \nand consumption of a healthful diet that restricts sugar-rich \nbeverages and high-carbohydrate, low-nutritional-value \nfoods is a must to promote health in the school-age \npopulation. Many pediatricians and pediatric primary \ncare providers do not promote \u201cdieting\u201d in the school-age \nFigure 9-6\u2002 Visual acuity screening should be performed for all \nschool-age children.\n\u00a9 KidStock/Blend Images/Getty\n116\t\nChapter 9\u2003 Caring for School-Age Children\n", "BEST PRACTICES\nDiscussion of Hand-off (Change-of-Shift \nReport or Multidisciplinary Rounds)\nSchool-age children should be allowed to be present during \ndiscussions of their treatment or during rounds if appropri\u00ad\nate. Because of their level of information processing, logical \nreasoning, and beginning abstract thinking, many, if not \nmost, school-age children can benefit from hearing about \ntheir condition and treatment plan. For young school-age \nchildren, having a Child Life specialist present to provide \nsupport and developmentally appropriate education during \nand after the discussion will allow the parents and healthcare \nteam to engage in reviewing and planning treatment for the \nchild\u2019s medical diagnosis. This sort of participation may not \nbe appropriate for school-age children with developmental \ndisabilities, cognitive impairment, anxiety disorders, or emo\u00ad\ntional distress.\nCase Study\nLogan, a 10-year-old boy, has a diagnosis of severe asthma \nthat requires him to have around-the-clock access to an \nemergency rescue inhaler of a beta-2 agonist (albuterol). \nLogan is very conscious of how his peers view him and hides \nhis albuterol inhaler in his athletic socks during school hours. \nBecause of his frequent use of oral steroids, he is currently \nin the 5th percentile for height and weight. Logan has ex\u00ad\nperienced bullying by his male peers and often plays and \neats alone during school. Upon questioning the pediatric \npulmonary team, the family is told that Logan will catch up \nin his expected height and weight once the frequency of his \noral steroid use diminishes.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t Why does Logan feel the need to hide his rescue medications?\n2.\t What are consequences of bullying (actual or the percep\u00ad\ntion of potential) for children in the school-age period?\nAs the Case Evolves.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nLogan has been referred for counseling because of his emo\u00ad\ntional issues related to bullying at school. During Logan\u2019s \ninitial discussion with the counselor about his experience in \nschool, it becomes clear that Logan is an outstanding student. \nHe completes all his homework on time and regularly scores \n100 on tests and quizzes. Logan explains to the counselor that \nhe likes doing schoolwork because \u201cit shows I can be good at \nsomething, no matter what those other kids say.\u201d\n3.\t According to Erikson, a behavior commonly associ\u00ad\nated with the psychosocial developmental stage of the \nschool-age child is:\nA.\t Enjoyment of repetitive tasks.\nB.\t Academic effort and accomplishments.\nC.\t Strong focus on social status with peers.\nD.\t Respect for rules and order.\nA year after the visit, Logan\u2019s use of inhaled steroids has \nsubstantially decreased, and his parents say they expect to \nsee an increase in his rate of growth. Upon assessing Logan\u2019s \ngrowth, the nurse notes that the 11-year-old has grown 1.5 \nin (3.75 cm) in the last 2 years\u2014still well below expectations. \n4.\t The nurse realizes that this child:\nA.\t Most likely has a growth hormone deficiency.\nB.\t Needs to catch up with his peers in average growth.\nC.\t Requires an immediate referral to the nutritionist.\nD.\t Will continue to be evaluated by anthropometrics \nduring future visits.\nLogan is learning coping skills from a counselor to help \nhim manage both his health issues and the negative peer \ninteractions he experiences because of his short stature.

This developmental period can be \nconceptualized as consisting of two distinct segments: \n(1) the early school-age period, in which the child is \nleaving the preschool developmental stage marked with \ndependence and magical thinking, and (2) the later \nschool-age period, when the child enters prepubescence.\n\u25c6\u25c6According to Erikson\u2019s theory, the school-age child is \nin the psychosocial stage of \u201cindustry versus inferior\u00ad\nity.\u201d Children of this age need the mastery of projects, \nacademics, and actions that make them feel as though \nthey are industrious, successful, and accomplished.\n\u25c6\u25c6Freud\u2019s theory describes the school-age child in the \ncontext of hidden, or latent, sexual desires and matu\u00ad\nrity. The school-age child has previously experienced \nthe oral stage of the infant, the anal stage of the toddler, \nand the phallic stage of the preschooler, but now enters \na period of quietness or dormancy related to sexuality.\n\u25c6\u25c6Moral development during the school-age period centers \non the development of and respect for rules, order, and \nexpectations. Kohlberg describes the school-age child as \nbeing in stage 2\u2014a stage characterized by the \u201cemergence \nof moral reciprocity,\u201d in which children believe that if \nthey do right, they will receive good back, and if they \nmake others happy, happiness will come back to them.\n\u25c6\u25c6Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development describes the \nschool-age period as characterized by concrete opera\u00ad\ntions. Logical thinking and basic inductive reasoning \nabout the world and life\u2019s events guide the child in pro\u00ad\ncessing information and developing thinking strategies.\n\u25c6\u25c6The end of the school-age period is marked by a specific \ngrowth experience called prepubescence, during which \nthe child develops secondary sex characteristics. Pre\u00ad\npubescence typically takes place over a two-year time \nframe in both boys and girls.\n\u25c6\u25c6Healthcare concerns for the school-age child include \nepidemics of infectious diseases such as measles and \npertussis, lice infestations, food allergies, and child\u00ad\nhood obesity rates. Emotional health concerns include \nincreasing rates of autism, attention-deficit disorder \nand attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnoses, \nmental health issues such as depression and anxiety, \nand bullying.\nBibliography\nAboujaoude, E., Savage, M.

Pediatric nurses, \nacross all settings, can be influential in reinforcing healthy \nbehaviors, encouraging positive relationships with those \nin authority, and educating teens on safety precautions in \ntheir choices and decisions.\nDevelopmental Theory\nThe adolescent period is marked by rapid physical growth, \nintellectual curiosity, emergence of sexual drives, and vacil\u00ad\nlating emotions. Based on its portrayal in many forms of \ncurrent media, adolescence appears to be a tumultuous \nperiod of sex, drug and alcohol use, injuries, gang life, and \nother self-destructive behaviors. In reality, most adolescents \nin the United States do well in academics, graduate from \nhigh school, and move on to have productive lives. They \nare attached to their families, seek opportunities to serve \ntheir communities, and generally do not succumb to the \npressures so often portrayed in the media, such as eating \ndisorders, gang violence, teen pregnancy, sexually transmit\u00ad\nted infections, alcoholism, and drug use. The adolescent \nperiod is a time of experimentation, but the majority of \nU.S. teens balance experimentation with success in school, \nsocial life, and family life.\nThe following subsections present the work of four \ntheorists whose contributions to a deeper understanding of \nthe developmental stages of childhood and adolescence can \nenhance the pediatric nurse\u2019s appreciation of those stages. \nThis body of work includes Erikson\u2019s psychosocial theory, \nPiaget\u2019s cognitive development theory, Freud\u2019s psychosexual \ntheory, and Kohlberg\u2019s theory of moral development.\nIntroduction\nThe adolescent developmental period marks the transition \nfrom childhood to physiological adulthood. Adolescence \nbegins at the onset of puberty\u2014usually begins anywhere \nfrom age 11 to 13\u2014and lasts through approximately \nage 18. It is considered the time period from the emer\u00ad\ngence of secondary sex characteristics through the \ncessation of growth (in height). Most care providers dis\u00ad\ntinguish between three distinct adolescent phases: early \n(approximately 11\u201313 years of age), middle (13\u201315 years \nof age), and late (15\u201318 years of age).\nDuring these developmental phases, individuals expe\u00ad\nrience tremendous physical growth, as well as cognitive, \nemotional, and sexual maturation. Emerging feelings of \nindependence and a move toward relating more to their \npeers than to their family (Figure 10-1) can lead adoles\u00ad\ncents to make decisions that highly influence their overall \nhealth and wellness. For instance, choices about food \nand meals, experimentation with expression of sexuality, \nindependence in learning and mastering driving, and \nexperiences with peer pressure can cause a teen to make \nsuboptimal choices that have lasting consequences. Con\u00ad\nformity is also a strong drive during adolescence and may \nlead the teen away from the family\u2019s cultural, religious, \nand ethnic practices.\nThe adolescent developmental period is also associated \nwith increased incidence of unintentional injuries, unin\u00ad\ntended pregnancies, and a higher risk for participating in \nviolent behaviors (Casey, Jones, & Hare, 2008). Although \nteens appear to be growing more independent, they are \nvery interested in the opinions and behaviors of the adults \nin their lives (Figure 10-2). It may appear that teens are \naloof or rebellious toward their parents\u2019 guidelines, rules, \npriorities, and opinions, but teens are actually listening and \nFigure 10-1\u2002 Adolescents experience emerging feelings of independence \nand movement toward relating more to their peers than their family.\n\u00a9 oneinchpunch/Shutterstock\nFigure 10-2\u2002 Even though feelings of independence increase, \nadolescents are very interested in the opinions and behaviors of the \nadults in their lives.\n\u00a9 Hero Images/Getty\n\t\nDevelopmental Theory\t\n121\n", "Figure 10-3\u2002 An adolescent may experiment with his or her sexuality \nand may develop intimate, loving relationships.\n\u00a9 Antonio Guillem/Shutterstock\nErik Erikson\u2019s Theory of Psychosocial Development\nAccording to Erikson\u2019s psychosocial theory, the adolescent \nis in the stage of self-identity versus role confusion. The \n\u201ccrisis\u201d (internal conflict) that adolescents must resolve \nis to determine their identity, or who they are, versus \nexperiencing confusion about their role or self-identity. \nErikson\u2019s theory suggests that successful navigation of \nthis stage through self-awareness and self-understanding \nallows teens to share themselves with others, feel healthy, \nand feel well adjusted. Ultimately, the teen can relate \nto and associate with others without losing the knowledge \nof or being uncertain about who he or she is.\nJean Piaget\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Development\nPiaget\u2019s cognitive theory describes the teen\u2019s mental pro\u00ad\ncessing as the stage of formal operations. Here, the teen has \nachieved deductive reasoning, propositional thought, and \nhigher processing of complex information than in previous \ndevelopmental stages. Formal operations are defined as both \nthe mental ability to determine a very likely outcome and \nthe processing of concrete, tangible, and intangible circum\u00ad\nstances. Abstract thinking develops during the teen years, \nwhich allows the adolescent to process difficult concepts.\nSigmund Freud\u2019s Theory of Psychosexual Development\nFreud\u2019s theory of psychosexual personality development \ndescribes the period of adolescence as being character\u00ad\nized by a sexual drive or sexual instinct that Freud called \n\u201cgenital.\u201d In this phase, the central \u201cconflict\u201d the teen must \nmaster and surpass is associated with the penis or vagina, \nand with sexual intercourse. The teen may experiment \nwith his or her sexuality. A successful resolution of the \nconflict is marked by the teen\u2019s ability to experience an \nintimate relationship with another once adolescence is \nover (McLeod, 2008) (Figure 10-3).\nLawrence Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development\nAccording to Kohlberg, the teen is experiencing conventional \nmorality. In this stage of development, the adolescent moves \nbeyond the previous focus on obedience, punishment, and \nthe perception that there is just one right view (the focus \nof the school-age child) and begins to internalize adult \nstandards of moral thinking, behaviors, and actions. The \nmain focus for the teen is to understand the principles of \ngood personal relationships; being seen as a good person \nbecomes a priority. Another focus is on the maintenance \nof social order, including wider social justice issues, and \nobeying rules. At the conclusion of this developmental \nperiod, the principle of authority is internalized (McLeod, \n2013; Oswalt, 2010).\nExpected Growth and Development: \nAdolescent\nAdolescence is marked by rapid growth in height, weight, \nhair growth and distribution, adipose distribution, and \nmaturation of the sexual organs. In addition, this period \nis defined by somatic maturity, reproductive capacity and \npsychosocial maturity. Most female teens will gain 1 to \n3\u00a0inches in height each year during early to middle ado\u00ad\nlescence, while male teens will gain 2 to 4 inches each year \nthroughout the adolescent time frame. Females typically \nstop gaining height around their 16th year, whereas most \nmales will experience a significant linear growth spurt in \nheight around their 13th year that may continue through \nlate adolescence, although the rate of growth may slow after \nage 17 (Rogol, Clark, & Roemmich, 2000; Rogol, Roem\u00ad\nmich, & Clark, 2002). Growth spurts are regulated by the \nrelease of gonadotropins, leptin, sex steroids, and growth \nhormones (Rogol et\u00a0al., 2002). Teens\u2019 nutrition\u2014that is, \nenergy intake in calories as well as nutrients\u2014will influ\u00ad\nence their rate of growth. Adolescent growth patterns are \nunique to each individual, however, and families need to \nunderstand that in the majority of cases when concern \narises regarding delayed growth, maturation, and puberty, \npatience is all that is required.\nIt is important to continue to compare adolescent \ngrowth to national standardized growth charts to see \nprevious trends and current status. (See the appendi\u00ad\nces for examples of growth charts that extend through \nadolescence.) Table 10-1 outlines expected development \nmilestones for adolescents.\nThe experience of puberty is central to the adolescent \nperiod. Prepubescence refers to the first signs of sexual/\nreproductive development through sexual maturation. \nPuberty is defined as the period in which sexual matu\u00ad\nration is completed, so that a teen is able to reproduce. \n122\t\nChapter 10\u2003 Caring for Adolescents\n", "TABLE 10-1\u2003\nAdolescent Development\nPhysical growth\n\u203a\u203a\nFemales: Overall weight gain averages 6.8\u201324 kg (15\u201355 lb)\n\u203a\u203a\nFemales: Overall height increase averages 5\u201321 cm (2\u20138 in)\n\u203a\u203a\nMales: Overall weight gain averages 6.8\u201330 kg (15\u201366 lb)\n\u203a\u203a\nMales: Overall height increase averages 10\u201331 cm (4\u201312 in) (Rogol et\u00a0al., 2000, 2002)\nNutrition\n\u203a\u203a\nTeens\u2019 caloric needs depend on their level of activity (sports and exercise) and can range from \n1800 to 2500 calories per day; averages are 45\u201370 kcal/kg of weight per day (Gidding et\u00a0al., 2006)\n\u203a\u203a\nAlthough all are important, iron, calcium, and protein are especially important nutrients for \nhealthy growth during adolescence; daily calcium needs are approximately 2200 mg, daily \nprotein needs are 46\u201344 g, and daily iron requirements are 8\u201318 mg, depending on gender \nand age\nMotor milestones\n\u203a\u203a\nFine motor skills: Easily manipulates complicated objects.

The age at which menses typically starts currently \nranges from 10 to 15 years, with the average being about \n12 years 5 months (American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, 2015). Nocturnal emissions\u2014that is, \nfirst ejaculation, also called \u201cwet dreams\u201d\u2014typically occur \nfor teen boys during early puberty.\nThe Tanner stages of sexual maturity are commonly used \nto distinguish between the phases of puberty. The Tanner \nstages describe the maturity phases of pubic hair growth \nand distribution, breast changes during puberty, and penile \nenlargement. Figure 10-5 illustrates the Tanner stages.\nCommunicating with Teens\nCommunicating with teenagers is not always easy. Estab\u00ad\nlishing a rapport with a teen often requires skill. One way \nto successfully establish rapport is to ask simple questions \nabout friends, family, in-school and after-school activities, \nwhere teens see themselves in three to five years, and how \nthey feel about a certain current event. Once eye contact \nand a pleasant rapport are established, the pediatric nurse \ncan explain that the conversation is considered private and \nconfidential, unless abuse is suspected. Teenagers often see \nthe pediatric nurse as a safe person to whom they can ask \nvery personal questions, disclose health concerns, solicit \nguidance on topics of sexuality, and receive honest, open, \nand accurate education.\nEach state in the United States has its own laws con\u00ad\ncerning the provision of assessments, distribution or \nprescriptions of birth control, and treatment for sexu\u00ad\nally transmitted infections (STIs). Currently, 21 states \nexplicitly allow children younger than age 18 (minors) \nto consent to and obtain contraceptive services without \nparental permission (Contracept.org, 2015); pediat\u00ad\nric nurses must know the state laws governing this \ncare where they are practicing.\nBEST PRACTICES\nAssessment and Education of Sexuality \nand Sexual Activity\nPediatric nurses need to be confident in initiating conversa\u00ad\ntions with teens about topics of sexuality and sexual activ\u00ad\nity. The nurse is often seen as a safe person to talk to, with \nwhom to discuss choices made or choices currently being \ncontemplated, and from whom to receive straightforward \nand accurate education. The pediatric nurse working with \nteens should keep in mind the following points:\n\u2022\t Gain trust and encourage the teen to \u201copen up\u201d by \nacknowledging that the teen may feel awkward.\n\u2022\t Know that preparation will promote safety and that \ntalking to teens about sex does not encourage sexual \nactivity.\n\u2022\t Be honest, straightforward, and willing to discuss any \ntopic from abstinence or birth control to anal sex\u2014\nwhatever the teen brings up should be discussed.\n\u2022\t Acknowledge that peer pressure is real, but empha\u00ad\nsize that it should not influence the teen\u2019s decisions.\n\u2022\t Do not make an assumption about what teens know, \nas they may act as if they know a great deal but have \nmany questions needing answers.\n\u2022\t Discuss the influence of the media and musical lyrics \non sexuality.\n\u2022\t Clarify that sexual activity needing precautions \nagainst sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is not \nlimited to vaginal/penis penetration.\n\u2022\t Educate teens that masturbation is normal and a \nhealthy part of growing up.\n\u2022\t Encourage teens to have a comprehensive physical \nexam that includes genital assessment, breast assess\u00ad\nment, and demonstration of breast self-exam and \ntesticular self-exams.\nData from Monasterio, E., Combs, N., Warner, L., Larsen-Fleming, M.,\u00a0& \nSt. Andrews, A.

A \nfew of the common health conditions of the adolescent \ndevelopmental period are described next.\nNutrition\nAdolescents are at risk for nutritional deficiencies. They are \ngrowing rapidly, have large appetites, and tend to crave fast \nfoods that are high in calories, sugars, fat, and sodium. Many \nteens seem to be \u201calways hungry\u201d; indeed, it is common \nto hear the phrase \u201chollow leg syndrome,\u201d meaning they \neat amounts of food beyond what is expected. Although \ngrowth spurts require increased protein and caloric intake, \nmany teens skip meals, snack throughout the day, and \nthen eat nutritious meals infrequently. Heavy homework \ndemands, socialization, and peer activities surrounding \nfast foods commonly affect the teen\u2019s proper eating habits.\nEating disorders are also a common concern during the \nadolescent period. Eating disorders can be devastating, in \nPlay and Recreation Needs \nof\u00a0the\u00a0Adolescent\nMost teenagers enjoy peer-related play and recreation. \nParticipation in team sports is common among this age \ncohort (Figure 10-6), youth groups are popular, and clubs \nare attractive to many teens. As teens typically desire more \nindependence from parents and family, guiding teens to \nhealthy, positive, and appropriate activities can enhance \ntheir emotional development.\nPediatric nurses caring for hospitalized teens need to \nplan for distraction, play, and recreation. Managing patients \nin the teen period requires thoughtful planning and con\u00ad\nsultation with a Child Life specialist. Some teens have their \nown laptop computers, homework, and cell phones. Others \nare open to engaging socially with other hospitalized teens \nand agree to participate in activities such as beading, card \nmaking, crafting, movie watching, and electronic video \ngaming. Regardless of how mature a teen might seem to \nan external audience, planning for recreation and distrac\u00ad\ntion is an important part of this patient\u2019s healing process.\nHealth Concerns for the Teenager\nMany health concerns are unique to the adolescent devel\u00ad\nopmental period. Owing to their increasing independence \nand increased time spent with peers rather than family, \nadolescents are at higher risk for experiencing health con\u00ad\ncerns based on poor eating patterns, high-risk behaviors \nand choices, and their growing, changing, and maturing \nbodies. Adolescent health concerns increase when assess\u00ad\nment, diagnosis, and treatment of common health conditions \nare delayed; thus, it is important to continue to provide \nanticipatory guidance during the teen years.

Non-inflammatory acne includes \nopen comedones (blackheads) and closed comedones \n(whiteheads); comedones are clogged oil glands (seba\u00ad\nceous glands). Whiteheads form as a result of an infection \naccompanied by an accumulation of white blood cells or \npus. The bacteria that most commonly cause teen acne are \nPropionibacterium acnes.\nPediatric nurses can be of assistance to adolescents who \nare experiencing significant acne by providing education \non skin hygiene (wash with mild soap at least twice a day), \ncleansing solutions with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, \nand nutrition. Nurses can also dispel myths about the \ncauses of acne: Acne is related more to the developmental \nperiod and hormone production, and less to conditions \nsuch as consuming certain foods or being in greasy work \nenvironments such as employment in fast-food restaurants.\nAlcohol and Drug Experimentation\nTeens commonly experiment with drugs and alcohol, and \nthis experimentation may have serious ramifications. Harm\u00ad\nful drinking increases risky behaviors such as unprotected \nsexual encounters and leads to a reduction of self-control \nbehaviors. Significant injuries, such as those associated \nwith violence and accidents, and early death experienced \nduring adolescence can be linked to experimentation with \nsubstances (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014).\nScreening for substance experimentation and abuse \nduring health check-ups, followed by referral for mental \nhealth assistance as needed, can save lives. For instance, \nscreening for marijuana use is important, as 6.5% of high \nschool seniors have been reported to use this substance on \nan almost daily basis (National Institute on Drug Abuse \n[NIDA], 2016).\nMental Health\nDepression is the most common contributing factor to \ndisability, illnesses, and suicide during adolescence (WHO, \n2014). Poor self-esteem, feeling devalued, bullying, poverty, \nand humiliation all negatively influence adolescent mental \nhealth conditions and concerns. Early screening for the \nsymptoms of depression can provide the pediatric nurse \nwith a foundation for referral and rapid interventions \nfor teens at risk for depression, anxiety, or other mental \nhealth issues.\nSexuality/Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted \nInfections\nAs of 2013, the rate of pregnancy and childbirth in the \nteen years had declined by 57% from its peak in 1991; \noverall sexual activity had likewise declined significantly \n(Martinez\u00a0& Abma, 2015). Today\u2019s high school students \nreport less sexual activity than the previous generation, and \nthat they can cause significant health problems and early \ndeath (Franko et\u00a0al., 2013; Smink, van Hoeken, & Hoek, \n2012). The most common eating disorders in the adoles\u00ad\ncent stage are binge-eating, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia \nnervosa. According to recent research, genetics, biological \nfactors, personality traits, pursuit of perfection, anxiety, \nand societal pressures (including becoming a star athlete) \ncan all contribute to the development of eating disorders \n(Keel & Forney, 2013). Pediatric nurses are in an excel\u00ad\nlent position to talk to teens about healthful eating, body \nimage (i.e., a person\u2019s perception of the attractiveness of \nhis or her own body), and self-esteem, and to screen for \nsigns of eating disorders.\nAnemia\nTeenagers, especially girls, are at risk for developing anemia, \na condition in which the blood lacks adequate numbers \nof red blood cells or hemoglobin. Risk factors include \niron-poor nutrition, heavy menses, and chronic illnesses \n(National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [NHLBI], \n2014; Sekhar, Murray-Kolb, Kunselman, & Paul, 2015). \nTeenagers who become pregnant are at a higher risk for \niron-deficiency anemia due to their need for twice as \nmuch oral iron intake as their nonpregnant peers (NHLBI, \n2014). Teenagers who complain of fatigue, loss of energy, \nshortness of breath, dizziness, leg cramps, insomnia, and \nloss of energy should be further assessed for anemia. If \nthe nurse notices pallor, pica, koilonychias (nails curved \nupward; spoon nails), mouth sores, or tachycardia, the \nteen should have a complete blood cell count performed. \nIron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 are all required for red \nblood cell (RBC) production; while they can take several \nweeks to work, supplements of these nutrients can be \nadministered if the etiology of the anemia is determined \nto be poor nutrition and low dietary iron consumption. \nFemales between 9 and 13 years of age should consume \n8 mg of iron per day, whereas females between 14 and 18 \nyears of age should consume 14 to 18 mg of iron per day \n(15 mg per day is the Recommended Daily Allowance \n[RDA] of iron). Pregnant teens need 27 mg of iron daily. \nMale teens need between 11 and 15 mg (11 mg RDA) of \niron per day (NHLBI, 2014).\nAcne\nBody image is a major concern for many teens, which \nexplains why the experience of acne may be profoundly \ndistressing during the teen years. During the adolescent \nperiod, hormones are released that increase the pro\u00ad\nduction of sebum from the oil-producing tissues called \nsebaceous glands. This process may lead to two forms of \nacne: inflammatory and non-inflammatory. Inflammatory \nacne includes papules, pustules, and cysts\u2014that is, large \n128\t\nChapter 10\u2003 Caring for Adolescents\n", "violence.

Male teens are at far \ngreater risk (three times as much as female teens) for \ninjuries, accidents, and death.

Table 10-3 identifies important teen \nsafety tips.\nthey have lower rates of teen abortions, teen pregnancy, \nand teen births. Nevertheless, several problematic trends \npersist. High school students report that 22% of the time, \nalcohol or drugs were involved in their last sexual experience \n(Hanes, 2012). An estimated 1 of every 6 boys (17%) and 1 \nof every 4 girls (25%) are sexually abused before the age of \n18, with 35.8% of teen rapes occurring in persons between \n12 and 17 years of age (U.S. Department of Justice, 2012).\nPediatric nurses are well positioned to provide confidential \nassessments, screening, and education for teens concern\u00ad\ning abstinence, protection from STIs and pregnancy, and \nviolence. Given that only 66% of males and 53% of females \nin the adolescent period report using condoms during their \nlast sexual encounter (Martinez & Abma, 2015), nurses \nhave the imperative to educate, support, and direct teens \nin safer sex practices.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nEncouraging Testing for HIV in Teens\nRecent research has disclosed that only 13% of adolescents \nhave ever been tested for human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV) infection, and only approximately 20% of gay ado\u00ad\nlescent males get HIV testing, despite the fact that 80% \nof new diagnoses in the 13\u201324 age range are gay and bi\u00ad\nsexual males. According to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC), the proportion of schools requiring \ninstruction on HIV prevention as an element of education \ndropped from 64% in 2000 to 41% in 2014. When a trusting \nrelationship is established and a male teenager discloses to \nthe nurse that he has experimented with homosexual sex\u00ad\nual activity, or when either a male or female teen discloses \nany high-risk sexual activity, the nurse should discuss and \nencourage HIV testing. \nData from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Locking drugs up from access, even from older teens, \ncan prevent dangers.\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (2016), \nthe following over-the-counter drugs and prescription \ndrugs were often taken for recreational purposes in 2015:\n\u2022\t Pain control medications such as hydrocodone \n(Vicodin) and oxycodone (OxyContin)\n\u2022\t Sleep assistance drugs such as Lunesta and Ambien\n\u2022\t Simulant drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and \namphetamine (Adderall)\n\u2022\t Antianxiety medications such as diazepam (Valium) \nand lorazepam (Ativan)\n\u2022\t Marijuana (prescription or \u201ccard holders\u201d)\n\u2022\t Cough syrups and tablets containing \ndextromethorphan\n\u2022\t Bath salts containing synthetic cathinones\nIncreased Emotional Reactivity\nDuring adolescence, with the change in their social en\u00ad\nvironment, the majority of most teens\u2019 time is spent with \npeers rather than with family members. During this time, \nconflicts are common between the teen and his or her \nparents. It is common for teens to defend their behaviors \nand choices, hide consequences for as long as possible, \nand argue with parents and adults concerning \u00adboundaries, \nchores, expectations for homework, and time away \nfrom home. Many adolescents experience an \u201cincreased \nemotional reactivity,\u201d in which their emotional state is \npronounced, their responses are exaggerated, their voices \nbecome loud, and their behaviors, in response to adult \nfeedback or attempts at control, become oppositional. \nMuch of this can be explained by their need and desire to \nbecome independent, trusted, and viewed as more of an \nadult than a child.\nThe pediatric nurse needs to provide parents with \nanticipatory guidance that conflicts with their teens are \nnormal and to be expected. Guidelines for parents include \nunderstanding this period so that conflicts, verbal assaults, \nand the need for demonstrative independence are limited; \nholding strong to communicating family values and pri\u00ad\norities; and continuing to express to the teen the need for \nfamily time. As difficult as it may be at times, teens often \nrespond to a call for quality family time and considerations \nfor special occasions that bring family members together. \nParents need to be encouraged to view the adolescent \nperiod as transitional and temporary.\n UNIQUE FOR KIDS\nNeurobiological and Cognitive Explanations \nfor Adolescent Behavior\nResearch has demonstrated that neural mechanisms within \nthe brain leave adolescents vulnerable to a \u201cheightened \nresponsiveness to incentives and socioemotional con\u00ad\ntexts\u201d (Casey et\u00a0al., 2008). Recent investigations involving \nbrain imaging have demonstrated that impulse control \nis immature during the teen years, as compared to dur\u00ad\ning adulthood. Scientists have found that impulsivity, \nwhich can lead teens to make risky decisions, diminishes \nwith age as the prefrontal cortex develops. According to \nCasey, Jones, and Hare (2008), prefrontal cortical control \nsystems need maturation before a teen can override the \npropensity to make inappropriate choices that lead to \nrisky behaviors.\nBEST PRACTICES\nAdministering Medications to Teenagers\n\u2022\t Teach teens, using straightforward and clear \nlanguage, about the medications they are on and \nwhy\u00a0they are taking them and for how long.\n\u2022\t Talk to teens about the \u201crights of safe medication \nadministration,\u201d so they are involved with their safety.\n\u2022\t Try to give teenagers responsibility for their \nmedication administration times.\n\u2022\t Most teenagers can swallow pills, but provide an \nalternative formulation if they are unable to do so.\n\u2022\t Teach teens about the importance of the medication, \nbased on the understanding that teens might hide \ntheir medications from their peers or be unwilling to \ntake medications during the day or at school where \npeers may cause them to be embarrassed or be \nteased\u2014they do not want to look \u201cdifferent\u201d from \ntheir peers.\n\u2022\t Discuss compliance and adherence, as teens who are \nresponsible for medication administration may feel \n\u201cinvincible\u201d and choose not to take their medications if \nthey do not feel they need them.\n130\t\nChapter 10\u2003 Caring for Adolescents\n", "middle (13\u201315 years of age), and late (15\u201318\u00a0years of age). \nDuring these developmental phases, teens experience tre\u00ad\nmendous physical growth, along with cognitive, emotional, \nand sexual maturation mixed with intellectual curiosity, \nemergence of their sexual drives, and vacillating emotions.\n\u25c6\u25c6Emerging feelings of independence and a move toward \nrelating more to their peers than to their family can lead \nChapter Summary\n\u25c6\u25c6Adolescence is considered the period from the begin\u00ad\nning of secondary sex characteristics development, \nthrough the end of the period of rapid growth in height \nand complete development of reproductive maturity \n(development of primary sex characteristics).\n\u25c6\u25c6Most care providers distinguish between three distinct \nadolescent phases: early (approximately 11\u201313 years of age), \nCase Study\nDanielle, a 15-year-old girl, has been contemplating starting \nbirth control pills.

In the UCSF model, the focus is placed on the \nnurse\u2019s understanding of the six symptoms of discomfort, \ndyspnea, nausea, emotional distress, fatigue, and sleep \ndisturbances. The model depicts the close relationships \nbetween the person\u2019s demographics, sociological, physi\u00ad\nological, psychological, and developmental aspects of \nsymptom experiences (Figure 11-1). It weaves together the \nimportance of symptom experiences, symptom manage\u00ad\nment strategies, and outcomes. Outcomes are described \nin terms of a person\u2019s functional status, emotional status, \nself-care, quality of life, and other factors. When applied \nto children, the UCSF model allows the pediatric nurse to \nbetter comprehend the complexities of symptom manage\u00ad\nment while understanding the uniqueness of the child, his \nor her environment, and his or her sense of well-being.\nIntroduction\nFor most pediatric patients and their caregivers, the ex\u00ad\nperience of disease symptoms is the principal factor that \ncauses them to seek care. The majority of hospitalizations \nand clinic visits for medical and nursing care are associ\u00ad\nated with the presence of symptoms requiring evaluation, \ntreatment, and management. Symptom management is \na large part of the holistic role of the nurse within all \nhealthcare settings. Untreated symptoms can have severe \nconsequences for the child\u2019s social, emotional, develop\u00ad\nmental, academic, and home life. Special attention to \nthe assessment, treatment, and continued management \nof symptoms is a critical responsibility of the practicing \nprofessional nurse.\nAlthough pain appears to be the symptom that has \ngarnered the most attention in the literature and in \npractice, the assessment, treatment, and continued \nmanagement of other symptoms requires consideration \nand study. This chapter discusses the symptoms of \npain, discomfort, fatigue, nausea, dyspnea, and sleep \ndisturbances.\nFigure 11-1\u2002 University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Nursing\u2019s Symptom Management Model.\nReproduced from Dodd, M., Janson, S., Facione, N., Faucett, J., Froelicher, E.

The \nexperience of pain is unique for each child, and is influ\u00ad\nenced by the child\u2019s individual cognitive, cultural, affective, \nbehavioral, and spiritual personal aspects. Understanding \nthe definition of pain is important and is the first step in \nappreciating the child\u2019s pain experience. According to the \nInternational Association for the Study of Pain (2014), \npain is a unique experience for each person that may \nbe defined as \u201c[a]n unpleasant sensory and emotional \nexperience associated with actual or potential tissue \ndamage, or described in terms of such damage.\u201d Pain \ntypically starts with a noxious stimulus (a precipitator \nof pain) and launches the process of the pain experience, \nwhich is highly influenced by the child\u2019s physiology and \nstate of health (Figure 11-2).\nPain Physiology\nTypically, pain occurs when an injury from chemical, ther\u00ad\nmal, pressure, or mechanical stimuli causes activation of \nthe free nerve endings (nociceptors) located within tissues. \nChemical substances released when tissues are damaged \nor injured activate the nerve endings and send signals \nvia afferent fibers to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord \n(Figure 11-3). From the dorsal horn, the message is then \ncarried to the brain for interpretation. The chemical sub\u00ad\nstances released during this process include prostaglandins, \nserotonin, bradykinins, histamine, and substance P. Two \nfibers are involved in this transmission of stimuli: A-delta \nfibers, which send messages of sharp pain, and unmyelin\u00ad\nated C fibers, which send signals for aching, diffuse and \nburning sensations.\nPain Experiences\nA person\u2019s pain threshold is defined as the minimal sen\u00ad\nsory stimulus that is perceived as a source of discomfort \nor pain. A\u00a0child\u2019s pain threshold is unique and variable. \nSome children have high pain thresholds and can experi\u00ad\nence or tolerate potentially painful stimuli before perceived \npain begins. Others have very low pain thresholds and \nperceive a pain experience with even low-level stimuli. \nThe challenge for the pediatric nurse is to understand \nthis principle, apply it to the assessment and manage\u00ad\nment of pain, and not pass judgment or be deterred from \nadequate and competent pain management regardless of \nhow children express their pain. This expression includes \nhow severe the pain experience is for each child, and how \nlow a pain threshold may be to require nursing interven\u00ad\ntion. Table 11-1 identifies the various types of pain that \nmay be distinguished.\nPediatric nurses must be aggressive in applying prin\u00ad\nciples of pain assessment and management to prevent the \nundertreatment of pain and discomfort. Undertreated pain \nleads to consequences that influence healing. A child with \nundertreated pain may experience short-term (immediate) \nand long-term sequelae.\nFigure 11-2\u2002 The experience of pain is highly influenced by a child\u2019s \npsychology and state of health.\n\u00a9 Juanmonino/E+/Getty\n\t\nPain\t\n135\n", "Figure 11-3\u2002 The pathway of pain. \nPain\nstimulation\non skin\nMessages\nfrom brain\nMessages\nto brain\nSensory\nneuron axon\nDorsal root\nDorsal root\nganglion\nSensory neuron\ncell body\nSensory\nneuron axon\nVentral\nroot\nMotor\nneuron\naxon\nSpinal\nnerve\nInterneuron\nMotor neuron \ndendrites\nMotor neuron \ncell body\nMuscle\nImmediate Responses\n\u2022\t Decreased oxygen saturation readings\n\u2022\t Rapid shallow breathing that can lead to a state of \nalkalosis\n\u2022\t Inadequate lung expansion, contributing to \natelectasis\n\u2022\t Increased heart rate and heart rate variability\n\u2022\t Increased systolic blood pressure\n\u2022\t Diaphoresis\n\u2022\t Guarding with decreased movements\n\u2022\t Restlessness preventing restfulness\n\u2022\t Decrease in peripheral blood flow to the skin\n\u2022\t Delayed wound healing\n\u2022\t Increased metabolic rate (especially in newborns \nand young infants with minimal stored resources or \nenergy)\n\u2022\t Increased loss of fluids and electrolytes\n\u2022\t Impaired gastrointestinal function, anorexia, and \nnausea\n\u2022\t Increased metabolic caloric consumption\n\u2022\t Prolonged hypoglycemia or\u2014with adrenal activa\u00ad\ntion and secretion of stress hormones\u2014prolonged \nhyperglycemia\n\u2022\t Mistrust in the child\u2019s environment\n\u2022\t Feelings of anxiety, stress, and sadness\nLong-Term Consequences\n\u2022\t Impaired inflammatory responses\n\u2022\t Decreased immune system function\n\u2022\t Poor motor performance\n\u2022\t Hypersensitivity to continued pain or new sources \nof discomfort\n\u2022\t Poor adaptive behavior, learning disorders, and \ncognitive defects\n\u2022\t Temperament changes and long-term psychosocial \nproblems\nPain Assessment\nThe assessment of a child\u2019s pain is crucial for the develop\u00ad\nment of a holistic nursing care plan (Figure 11-4). The \nlocation and severity of the pain are important factors, but \nso are the circumstances surrounding the pain experience. \nPain is a unique human experience, yet some physical cues \nare consistent across the various developmental stages \n(Table 11-2).\nWhen faced with a child experiencing pain, the assess\u00ad\nment should start with background information. The nurse \nshould ask the following questions:\n\u2022\t What are child\u2019s previous experiences with pain?\n\u2022\t How did the child find relief? Which specific pain \ninterventions have worked in the past for the child?\n\u2022\t How does the child display symptoms of pain? Is \nthe child verbal about pain or does the child be\u00ad\ncome quiet?\n\u2022\t If verbal, which words does the child currently use \nto express pain?\n\u2022\t What are the child\u2019s experiences with non-narcotic \nand narcotic pain control medications?\n136\t\nChapter 11\u2003 Symptom Management Across Childhood\n", "TABLE 11-1\u2003\nTypes of Pain Experiences\nAcute pain: Often has a sudden onset; associated with trauma, injury, surgical wounds, and severe inflammation.\nChronic pain: Pain that persists for months, may progress, and is often resistant to traditional or standard pain medical treatments.\nEpisodic pain: Recurring pain that comes in intervals, such as acute episodic pain associated with sickle cell anemia\u2019s acute vaso-\nocclusive episodes. Episodic pain can be unpredictable and debilitating.\nIdiopathic pain: Pain described or experienced by a child even in the presence of no identifiable pathological condition that \nwould contribute to the source of the discomfort.\nBreakthrough pain: The experience of continued and increasing pain above the child\u2019s baseline pain experience. Also, pain \nthat emerges during a period of symptom management and may be associated with new activity or increased movement.\nNeuropathic pain: Persistent discomfort that is experienced in the presence of structural damage, lesions or disease, or nerve \ncell dysfunction or injury within the central or peripheral nervous system (somatosensory). Neuropathic pain, which can be \ndescribed as a sensory dysfunction, may be expressed in the following ways:\n\u203a\u203a\nHyperalgesia (increased pain response to stimuli that do not normally cause a child pain)\n\u203a\u203a\nHypoalgesia (diminished pain response to normally painful stimuli)\n\u203a\u203a\nParesthesia (abnormal sensations experienced after exposure to stimuli, such as tingling, stinging, and numbness)\n\u203a\u203a\nHyperesthesia (increased sensitivity to stimuli)\n\u203a\u203a\nHypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli)\nNociceptive pain: Pain that arises from tissues other than nerve tissue or cells and caused by the activation of nociceptors \n(sensory receptor of the peripheral nervous system).\nSomatic pain: Pain caused by activation of the nociceptors in surface tissues such as the child\u2019s skin and mucosa, or deep tissues \nsuch as the child\u2019s muscles, connective tissues, bones and joints. \n\u203a\u203a\nNociceptive superficial somatic: Pain in the anus, urethra, skin, nose, and mucosa of the mouth\n\u203a\u203a\nNociceptive deep somatic: Pain in the bones, joints, connective tissues, and muscles\nVisceral pain: Pain caused by the activation of the nociceptors in visceral tissues.

Oakbrook Terrace, IL: Joint Commission Resources.\nPain assessment tools are critical to adequately managing \npain for children. Many effective, reliable, and valid tools \nare available for use in children spanning the developmen\u00ad\ntal period. The nurse should take into consideration three \ntypes of assessments:\n\u2022\t Biophysical assessments of pain through vital signs \nmeasurement and oxygen saturation findings\n\t\nPain\t\n137\n", "TABLE 11-2\u2003\nDevelopmental Aspects of Pain Expression\nPain may be expressed through common physical or behavioral findings in each of the developmental periods:\n\u203a\u203a\nFetus: Fetuses who are at least 8 weeks\u2019 gestational age respond to touch. After 20 weeks\u2019 gestation, a fetus will recoil from a \npainful stimulus (Gupta, Kilby, & Cooper, 2008).\n\u203a\u203a\nInfant: Infants display pain by crying, drawing eyebrows together, squeezing eyes shut, open and rectangle-shaped look to \nthe mouth, and quivering chin. Body tension, fist clenching, arching, and flailing are other indicators of pain.\n\u203a\u203a\nToddler: Owing to their limited verbal skills, toddlers will display pain through grimacing, limb movement, grasping onto an \nobject or their caregiver, crying, groaning, and moaning.\n\u203a\u203a\nPreschooler: Given their expanding verbal skills, most preschoolers can use a 4- to 5-item discrimination scale such as \nthe Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. They demonstrate pain though crying, whimpering, grasping onto an object \nor person, limb movement, and distinct facial features including eye squeezing, flared nostrils, furrowed forehead, and \nmouth\u00a0stretching.\n\u203a\u203a\nSchool age: Most school-age children verbalize their pain experience as well as expressing themselves nonverbally. \nThese children display facial expressions of pain, crying, and body movements of thrashing, leg movement, or recoiling. \nDevelopmental regression may occur with pain experiences. The FACES Scale, Visual Analogue Scale, numeric scales, \nand Adolescent Pediatric Pain Scale have all been used in this age group successfully, although the last two instruments \nrequire a more advanced comprehension of numeric values and vocabulary than are typically found in children younger \nthan age 10. \n\u203a\u203a\nAdolescent: When in front of peers, adolescents may hide or minimize their pain symptom display. Teens are typically very \nverbal about their pain and communicate in detail various aspects of the pain experience. They may show pain through \nfacial features and body posturing. They may be tearful or act stoically. Pain assessment is often best accomplished using \nthe\u00a0Adolescent Pediatric Pain Scale, as it allows for a more nuanced expression of a teenager\u2019s experience.\nData from Srouji, R., Ratnapalan, S., & Schneeweiss, S.

The child\u2019s autonomic nervous \nsystem may be activated during a painful event and may\u2014or \nmay not\u2014cause fluctuations in vital signs. Because research \nhas demonstrated that vital signs changes occur with the \napplication of a nociceptive procedure, experts suggest that \nmeasurement of vital signs be used as part of a full pain as\u00ad\nsessment (Arbour, Choiniere, Topolovec-Vranic, Loiselle, & \nGelinas, 2014). The pediatric nurse performing the pain \nassessment should be aware of how vital signs generally \nreflect the experience of pain:\n\u2022\t Heart rate: Heart rate becomes elevated with \nan acute pain experience or an exacerbation of \nchronic\u00a0pain.\n\u2022\t Respiratory rate: Typically, pediatric respirations \nwill be faster and more shallow with acute pain.\n\u2022\t Systolic blood pressure: During a pain episode, a \nchild\u2019s systolic blood pressure will increase.\n\u2022\t Temperature: Although a child\u2019s temperature will \nnot fluctuate with pain, the child may demonstrate \ndiaphoresis and elevated temperature if experienc\u00ad\ning pain associated with infectious processes, with \nthese effects then contributing to the child\u2019s overall \ndiscomfort.\n\u2022\t Oxygen saturation: During acute pain episodes and \nchanges in breathing patterns, a child\u2019s oxygen satu\u00ad\nration measurement may decrease.\nSubjective Tools\nSubjective tools\u2014that is, tools that can be used to obtain the \nchild\u2019s own assessment of his or her pain experience\u2014have \nbeen validated and deemed reliable across childhood from \nthe young preschool period onward. For children who do \nnot have cognitive impairments or changes in their level \nof consciousness, and who are able to express themselves \nverbally, the administration of subjective tools has been \nshown to be of great value in pediatric pain management. \nSubjective tool use can begin in the early years of the pre\u00ad\nschool developmental period.\n138\t\nChapter 11\u2003 Symptom Management Across Childhood\n", "Preschoolers\nAppropriate tools for assessing pain in preschoolers include \nthe Wong-Baker FACES Scale and the Oucher Scale.\n\u2022\t Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (Figure 11-5): \nA series of six drawings of a simple face character \nthat expresses a range of facial features, from smil\u00ad\ning (no pain) to crying intensely (score of 10).\n\u2022\t Oucher Scale (Figure 11-6): A series of six photo\u00ad\ngraphs of children appearing to experience increas\u00ad\ning levels of pain.

Rating can be done via a verbaliza\u00ad\ntion of the numbers \u201czero to ten\u201d or by presenting \nthe child with a scale of numbers.\n\u2022\t Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; Figure 11-8): The \nchild is presented with a 100-mm line on a paper \nor card, with \u201cno pain\u201d written at one end of the \nline and \u201cworst possible pain\u201d written at the other \nend. The patient is asked to draw a perpendicular \nline according to where his or her pain falls. The \nnurse then uses a 100-mm ruler to determine \nthe\u00a0final pain scale value; numbers range from zero \nto 100. The VAS can also be presented as a \u201cpain \nthermometer\u201d concept. It shows good sensitivity \nand validity for most children from approximately \nage 7 and older (Srouji, Ratnapalan, & Schnee\u00ad\nweiss, 2010; von Baeyer, 2006). Given a choice, \nthough, many children prefer using the FACES \nScale over a VAS measurement (von Baeyer, 2006).\n\t\nPain\t\n139\n", "to the healthcare team member a number of aspects or \ndimensions of their pain experience. The tool consists of \nthree categories: (1) a body diagram that allows the child \nto point to an anatomic location; (2) a word\u2013graphic rat\u00ad\ning scale, usually consisting of a line with anchor points \nthat identify a pain spectrum ranging from \u201cno pain\u201d to \n\u201cworst possible pain\u201d; and (3) a selection of words that \nallows the child to choose descriptions of the nature of the \npain (e.g., burning, stinging, aching, throbbing) and its \ntiming (e.g., always, sometimes, at night, during the day). \nThese descriptors were identified in a three-phase research \nprocess involving more than 1200 children, both healthy \nand hospitalized, ranging in age from 8 to 17. The first two \nphases identified words that were useful and meaningful to \nthe children, while the third phase validated the reliability \nof the pain descriptors selected (Fernandes, De Campos, \nBatalha, Perdig\u00e3o, & Jacob, 2014; Srouji et\u00a0al., 2010).\n\u2022\t Poker chip tool: Most commonly, the nurse pro\u00ad\nvides the child with a stack of five poker chips of \nthe same color, spreads them out in a row, and \ncommunicates that they represent \u201cpieces of hurt\u201d \n(Srouji et\u00a0al., 2010; von Baeyer, 2006). The child \nthen chooses the number of chips to represent \nhis or her pain, from zero chips (no pain) to five \nchips (representing the most intense pain the child \ncan imagine). Some institutions have used a more \nsophisticated process of color-coding the chips to \nrepresent various degrees of pain intensity.\nAdolescents\nAppropriate pain assessment tools include the Numeric \nRating Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale, and the Adolescent \nPediatric Pain Tool.\nThe Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool provides the op\u00ad\nportunity for older children and teenagers to communicate \nFigure 11-8\u2002 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). \nNo\nPain\nWorst\nPain\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nAssessing Pain in the Adolescent: Essential \nComponents\nDue to their age, most teens will have had a life experience \nof a painful stimulus and, therefore, can benchmark a current \npain experience against their previous pain experiences. \nTeens want to express themselves in regard to pain in terms \nof onset, location, duration, severity, and described sensory \nexperience. Time is required to conduct a holistic assessment \nof a teenager\u2019s pain, and nurses should allow sufficient time \nfor this interaction. Administering a pain scale tool that allows \nthe older child to draw where the pain is, use shading to show \nseverity, use descriptive words to articulate the type of pain \nand sensations, and use words denoting both chronology \nand intensity typically works well for most developmentally \nintact adolescents.\nThe maturity of an adolescent is both a benefit and a draw\u00ad\nback to the provider. On the one hand, teens are capable of \nproviding more detailed and nuanced information than younger \nchildren. On the other hand, their developmental phase\u2014which \nemphasizes differentiating themselves from parental and other \nforms of authority\u2014may diminish their willingness to speak \nopenly with healthcare providers about their experiences \n(Murphy, 2011), particularly if the nature of the pain is highly \nsensitive (e.g., genitourinary tract pain) or if they fear disclosure \nof their condition to the parent. Parental assessment of pain \noften differs from the teen\u2019s own assessment (Vetter, Bridge\u00ad\nwater, Ascherman, Madan-Swain, & McGwin, 2014). Offering \na pain assessment tool that is intended for younger children \n(e.g., the Wong-Baker FACES Scale) may be counterproductive, \nas the teen may feel disrespected or patronized and, in turn, \nbecome uncommunicative. Try to provide an opportunity to \ncomplete a thorough pain assessment in privacy so the teen \nfeels respected and can engage in open discussion without \nworry about responses from family, peers, or other patients.\nFigure 11-7\u2002 Numerical Rating Scale. \n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n7\n8\n9\n0\nNo\nPain\n5\nModerate\nPain \n10\nWorst\nPain\n140\t\nChapter 11\u2003 Symptom Management Across Childhood\n", "Objective Tools\nObjective pain tools allow the nurse to identify behaviors \nin infants and young children that are expressions of pain. \nThese tools are very helpful in assessment and management \nof preverbal or nonverbal children\u2019s pain.

Thus, selection of the appropriate phar\u00ad\nmacologic pain control treatment is based on the child\u2019s \nsubjective pain scale score, along with the nurse\u2019s objective \npain scale score on behalf of the child.\nTable 11-3 lists medications that are commonly used \nto treat mild to severe pain in children.\nTABLE 11-3\u2003\nMedications Used for Pain Control in Children\nNon-Opioid Medications for Pain\n\u203a\u203a\nCholine magnesium trisalicylate: 25 mg/kg PO every \n12\u00a0hours\n\u203a\u203a\nAcetaminophen: 10\u201315 mg/kg PO every 4\u20136 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nIbuprofen: 5\u201310 mg/kg PO every 6 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nNaproxen: 5\u201310 mg/kg PO every 12 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nKetorolac: 1 mg/kg IV loading dose, followed by 0.5 mg/\nkg up to 30 mg IV maximum in children every 6 hours, for \nno more than 5 days\nNarcotic Medications for Pain\n\u203a\u203a\nFentanyl: 5\u201315 mcg/kg PO or 0.5\u20132 mcg/kg every 1\u20132 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nHydromorphone: 0.03\u20130.08 mg/kg PO every 4 hours, or \n0.01\u20130.015 mg/kg IV every 3\u20134 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nLevophanol: 0.04 mg/kg PO every 6\u20138 hours, or 0.02 mg/\nkg IV every 6\u20138 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nMethadone: 0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg PO every 12\u201336 hours, or \n0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg every 12\u201336 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nMorphine: 0.05\u20130.1 mg/kg IV every 2\u20134 hours, or 0.3 mg/\nkg PO every 3\u20134 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nOxycodone: 0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg PO every 3\u20134 hours\n\u203a\u203a\nTramadol: 1\u20132 mg/kg PO every 4\u20136 hours \n(investigational)\ndevelopmental delays.

This lack of response and failure to show the \nclassic displays of discomfort and pain that pediatric nurses \nrely on for assessments can place a developmentally delayed \nchild at risk for poor management. \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nC\nhildren who have developmental delays are at risk for poor \npain assessment and pain control. According to Gilbert-\nMacLeod, Craig, Rocha, and Mathias (2000), developmentally \ndelayed children may display a lower-intensity pain distress \nresponse to a pain stimulus compared to children without \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nAssessments and Interventions for Respiratory \nDepression with Narcotic Pain Control\nThe development of respiratory depression in children who \nreceive narcotics for pain control, also known as opioid-induced \nrespiratory depression (OIRD), is both rare and unpredictable. \nIf dosed within the safe dose range for a narcotic medication \nand given the medication only at the recommended time \nintervals, a child in pain should not be expected to experi\u00ad\nence any respiratory depression. Clinical symptoms of OIRD \ninclude unresponsiveness, progressive decreasing respiratory \nrate with shallow breathing, and small pupils. Fatalities are \npossible in children with OIRD due to airway obstruction by \nthe child\u2019s tongue. Nurses must be able to identify patients \nwho are at risk for opioid-induced respiratory depression \nand advancing sedation (Jarzyna et\u00a0al., 2011). Confounding \nfactors include renal impairment, frequency of medication \ndosage times, sensory deafferentation (Dahan, Overdyk, Smith, \nAarts, & Niesters, 2013), obesity, respiratory disorders and \npulmonary diseases, female sex, and breathing disorders \nduring sleep (Overdyk et\u00a0al., 2014). \nBecause OIRD can be fatal, and due to the unpredictability \nof its occurrence, recommendations for managing children \nwho are receiving narcotic pain control in hospital settings \ninclude continuous monitoring of respiratory rate and oxygen \nsaturations. OIRD is most often associated with morphine use \nand typically occurs in the pediatric postoperative period. \nInterventions to reverse narcotic agents in the presence of \nrespiratory depression include naloxone (10 mcg/kg mixed \nwith saline to yield 0.5 mcg/kg every 1 to 2 minutes).\nPHARMACOLOGY\nM\neperidine (Demerol) is rarely administered to children \ndue to its toxic metabolite, normeperidine.

After performing subjective and objective \nassessments of the pain, the nurse focuses on establishing \ngoals for pain control and interventions that concentrate \non pain alleviation. Ultimately, the goal is to remove or \nreduce the cause of the discomfort or pain. The following \ninterventions may be administered following a thorough \npain assessment using the principles of anticipation and \nproactive nursing care:\n\u2022\t Use topical cream anesthetics such as EMLA before \nstarting intravenous (IV) infusions or giving injec\u00ad\ntions (not on young infants).\nNonpharmacologic Pain Control\nResearch has shown that \u201cclosing the pain gate\u201d by inhibit\u00ad\ning pain impulses being carried to the brain is effective in \nmanaging many sources of pain. Application of ice, pressure, \nor massage can cause the A-beta fibers to reduce or inhibit \ntransmission of pain stimuli through the substantia gelatinosa, \nwhich is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This \nhelps in blocking messages to the brain. Other complementary \npain-reducing or pain-relieving interventions that have been \nsuccessfully applied to children include the following options:\n\u2022\t Distraction via sensory stimulation (auditory, \n\u00advisual, olfactory) through reading, music, \nand arts\n\u2022\t Hypnosis to facilitate awareness, concentration \naway from pain stimuli, and an increased state of \nrelaxation\n\u2022\t Guided imagery to provide progressive muscle relax\u00ad\nation or focused concentration on pleasant mental \nimages such as the ocean, hiking, playing, or dancing\n\u2022\t Breathing techniques to relax and reduce anxiety\n\u2022\t Sucrose solutions (typically 1 to 2 mL of \n24%\u00a0\u00adsucrose solution) administered just before a \npainful procedure\n\u2022\t Holding and rocking a young child\nNursing Diagnoses for Pain\nThe over-arching nursing diagnosis associated with discom\u00ad\nfort and pain is impaired comfort.

Norme\u00ad\nperidine can build up in the child\u2019s system with prolonged use \nand cause neurologic side effects such as shaking, tremors, \nanxiety, hyperreflexia, mood changes, hallucinations, and \nseizures. These toxic outcomes can occur within only 24 hours \nof dosing with meperidine (DePriest, Puet, Holt, Roberts, & \nCone, 2015).\nFigure 11-10\u2002 A pain control plan for a child may include patient-\ncontrolled analgesia. \n\t\nPain\t\n143\n", "Nausea may be caused by any number of noxious stimuli \nthat affect the vomiting center either directly or indirectly. \nThe vomiting center, which is located in the medulla ob\u00ad\nlongata, comprises both the nucleus of the tractus solitaries \nand the reticular formation. When it is activated, electrical \nmessages are sent via the fifth, seventh, ninth, 10th, and \n12th cranial nerves to the GI tract, and sympathetic and \nvagal nerve messages to the lower GI tract. Chemicals can \nhave an immediate direct effect on the vomiting center \nin the brain, or indirect stimulation can occur in one of \nfour areas: the gastrointestinal system, the chemoreceptor \ntrigger zone, the vestibular region, or the cerebral cortex \nand thalamus. The chemoreceptor trigger zone is easily \npermeated by nausea-inducing chemicals and irritants \nbecause it is not surrounded by the tightly constructed \ncapillaries and protective endothelium associated with the \nblood\u2013brain barrier. When this zone is stimulated, reverse \nperistalsis occurs, sending the intestinal contents from \nthe lower small intestine to the upper small intestine, and \nthen into the stomach. During vomiting, the esophageal \nsphincter relaxes, sending the stomach contents up to the \nchild\u2019s mouth (Becker, 2010).\nThe act of vomiting, or emesis, is a clinical sign of \nnausea, and may be accompanied by retching. As it is a \nstrong muscular event, a child may retch without passing \ngastric contents.\nNausea is common in the postoperative period. Though \nthis phenomenon is known as postoperative nausea and \nvomiting (PONV), the experience of nausea may precede \nthe act of vomiting, or vomiting may occur without first \nexperiencing nausea. The pediatric nurse should expect \nand plan for the assessment and treatment of PONV.\nAssessment of Nausea\nThe pediatric nurse should assess the child\u2019s level of de\u00ad\nscribed nausea. For children with a grasp of \u201cmore\u201d and \n\u201cless\u201d in a numeric sense, a 0 to 10 numeric scale can be \nused to describe the intensity of the nausea. With nonver\u00ad\nbal children, the nurse has added challenges in assessing \nnausea. A quiet child, holding the stomach, with closed \neyes, lying still on one side or curled in a fetal position, \nmay indicate nausea. It is important that the nurse take \ninto account the reason for the young child\u2019s unexpected \nbehaviors and assume that nausea is present before the \nchild begins to retch or vomit.\nAfter assessment of the severity of the nausea, the pe\u00ad\ndiatric nurse should discern the cause of this symptom. \nCauses may be emotional, physical, or a result of medical \ntreatment. A variety of emetogenic (vomiting-inducing) \nmedications are administered in healthcare settings, and \ntheir administration must be identified\u2014the need for re\u00ad\npeated dosing will require antiemetics to be offered either \n\u2022\t Believe children about their pain: Pain is a \n\u00adsymptom that occurs whenever a child says it does. \nTake all reports of pain seriously and intervene \nappropriately.\n\u2022\t Listen carefully to a child\u2019s communication and \ndescription of the pain experience, regardless of \nthe child\u2019s developmental stage or ability to express \nhimself or herself.\n\u2022\t Expect variations in children of similar ages, as \npain thresholds vary with developmental stages, \ndiagnoses, and surgical procedures.\n\u2022\t Inquire about previous pain experiences and ways \nof coping that were successful.\n\u2022\t Involve parents and caregivers in pain assessment \nand interventions.\n\u2022\t Understand that fatigue, anxiety, and fear can \n\u00adincrease a child\u2019s sensitivity to pain.\n\u2022\t Use a variety of words to describe pain; take into \naccount the child\u2019s developmental level and the \nwords the family uses. Ask the parents which \nwords they use (ouch, ouchie, booboo, owie, \nhurtie); write the words on a card and keep the \ncard at the bedside. Document these preferences \nfor the interdisciplinary team.\n\u2022\t Use a team approach for pain control, including \nChild Life specialists.\n\u2022\t Assess the effectiveness of pain interventions within \n1 hour; document the findings.\n\u2022\t Provide ongoing education and support for parents \nor guardians.\n\u2022\t Explain to parents that addiction to narcotics in the \npresence of pain is a rare phenomenon.\n\u2022\t Understand the potential side effects of narcotics \nadministration, including gastrointestinal distress, \nnausea, constipation, intense itching, and sedation. \nEducate parents on what to expect.\nNausea\nChildren typically have many experiences with nausea (upset \nstomach, which may be followed by vomiting) throughout \ntheir childhood. Children encounter many potential etiolo\u00ad\ngies of gastrointestinal (GI) distress. For example, acute viral \ngastroenteritis, food allergies, intolerance to foods, food \npoisoning, motion sickness, severe abdominal pain, overeat\u00ad\ning, intestinal blockages or obstructions, and medications \nsuch as oral antibiotics, chemotherapy, and anesthesia may \nall potentially trigger nausea. Nausea may resolve on its \nown, but for some children, antinausea medications are \nrequired for elimination or control of this symptom. The \nexperience of nausea is both troubling to the child and fam\u00ad\nily and concerning for the nurse caring for the child. Put \nsimply, the experience of nausea makes a child miserable.\n144\t\nChapter 11\u2003 Symptom Management Across Childhood\n", "When the nausea has resolved and there has been no \nvomiting for several hours, introduce fluids and foods \nslowly. Chilled fluids may be tolerated well by older chil\u00ad\ndren. Many children enjoy small ice chips after a period \nof nausea and vomiting. Small servings of low-fat, visually \nappealing foods without strong aromas may help the child \nbegin to eat again.\nThe pediatric nurse must assess for complications of \nprolonged nausea and vomiting. Monitor for blood in \nthe vomit (hematemesis), dehydration, and the presence \nof debilitating abdominal pain and cramping. Report any \npassage of fecal material in the vomit.\nFatigue\nFatigue is a complicated human experience and is actually \nconsidered quite common across the lifespan. The experi\u00ad\nence of fatigue can provoke a frustrating and disruptive \ndaily state that affects a child\u2019s ability to function, eat well, \nsleep well, play, interact and socialize, and perform activi\u00ad\nties of daily living.\nIn children, fatigue is often described as a state of be\u00ad\ning tired, exhausted, wearied, or unmotivated, with poor \nenergy and poor concentration. Fatigue may also be as\u00ad\nsociated with hyperthermia or fever. Children may report \nhaving significantly reduced ability or capacity to perform \ndaily work, play, and interactions with others. Regardless \nof the expansive research that exists on fatigue in children, \nhowever, there is no single well-accepted definition of this \nphenomenon. Instead, the child\u2019s personality, culture, social \nsupport, family network, physical environment, and health \nstate all combine to make the experience of fatigue unique. \nMore generally, fatigue can be conceived as a continuum \nfrom unpleasant to mildly distressing to severely disabling.\nas premedications or around the clock (ATC). Medica\u00ad\ntions that can cause nausea in children include inhaled \nanesthetics, chemotherapy, opioids administered for pain, \nand several antibiotics.\nNursing Diagnoses for Nausea\nAs noted earlier, nausea may be related to stimulation of \nthe vomiting center. In addition, it may reflect fluid imbal\u00ad\nance owing to lack of oral intake of fluids.\nMedical Treatments for Nausea\nAntiemetics, which block receptors on the cells of the vom\u00ad\niting center, are the medical cornerstone for the control or \nalleviation of nausea. If the emetogenic trigger is vestibular \nin nature (such as in motion sickness), medications are \ngiven that block histamine and acetylcholine. If the trigger \nis linked to use of opioids or anesthetics, antiemetics that \nblock dopamine will be most effective. In the vomiting \ncenter itself, serotonin antagonists are most effective. In \naddition, anxiolytics may be useful in children who have \nrepeated emetogenic experiences such as chemotherapy and \nendure anticipatory nausea and vomiting (Becker, 2010).\nCommon antiemetic medications administered to \nchildren include the following agents:\n\u2022\t Serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron (Zofran)\n\u2022\t Tricyclic antidepressants such as promethazine \n(Phenergan) (not recommended for children \nyounger than age 2)\n\u2022\t Phenothiazine such as prochlorperazine (Com\u00ad\npazine) (not recommended for children younger \nthan age 2)\n\u2022\t Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) \n(indicated for motion sickness)\n\u2022\t Gut motility stimulators such as metoclopramide \n(Reglan)\n\u2022\t Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron)\n\u2022\t Anticholinergic agents approved for pediatric use\nNursing Care for Nausea\nChildren need to be soothed and cared for when they are \nexperiencing the misery of nausea. It may be better to \nrefrain from offering food and drink until the sensation \nsubsides. Antinausea medications should be administered \nif ordered, and the cause of the nausea must be identified. \nThe child should be placed in a semi-Fowler\u2019s or side-lying \nposition in case the nausea is accompanied with vomit\u00ad\ning, which carries a risk of aspiration (Figure 11-11). \nThe child should remain in a cool, quiet, low-stimulation \nenvironment. Encourage stress reduction behaviors such \nas deep breathing, relaxation, and sleep. When a child is \nvomiting, follow-up oral care is important to protect the \nintegrity of the teeth.\nFigure 11-11\u2002 A child with nausea should be placed in a semi-Fowler\u2019s \n(pictured here) or side-lying position in case the nausea is accompanied \nwith vomiting, which carries a risk of aspiration. \n\u00a9 monkeybusinessimages/iStock/Getty Images Plus/Getty\n\t\nFatigue\t\n145\n", "be situational, acute, chronic, or disabling. Assessment of \na child\u2019s state of depression should go hand in hand with \nthe assessment of fatigue. One lens through which to view \nfatigue is to consider whether the experience is primary \nor secondary. Primary fatigue is associated directly with \na mental health issue or a physical disorder. By compari\u00ad\nson, secondary fatigue is associated with a progression or \nworsening of symptoms owing to a disease state, medical \ntreatment, or surgical intervention.\nFatigue can cause severe functional impairment that \naffects both the child\u2019s education and his or her socializa\u00ad\ntion. Fatigue at the level that is considered disabling is the \nprimary reason for children\u2019s prolonged absences from \nacademic settings (Fowler, Duthie, Thapar, & Farmer, \n2005). Fatigue can be associated with mental health is\u00ad\nsues, medical treatments for acute and chronic illnesses, \nor physiological disruptions such as anemia, or it can exist \nwithout a psychological or physiological etiology.\nIt is very important that the child expresses his or her \nexperiences and sensations associated with fatigue so that \ninterventions can be initiated and individualized. The pedi\u00ad\natric nurse should look objectively at the fatigue symptoms \npresented and, when the child is able, encourage the child \nto provide a subjective description of the fatigue experience. \nThe healthcare team then needs to look at the greater health \ncontext in which fatigue has developed, including illness, \ndisease, and comorbidity with mental health disorders.\nFatigue has unique sensations that are described dif\u00ad\nferently by children in each developmental stage. Among \nverbal children, fatigue has been described as a physical \nsensation, alternating and sometimes merging with mental \ntiredness. Many school-age and adolescent children indicate \nthat their primary means to alleviate fatigue comes from \npacing\u2014that is, a balance of resting periods and play or \ndistractions (Goudsmit, Nijs, Jason, & Wallman, 2012).\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven\u00ad\ntion (CDC), the definition of chronic fatigue \u00adsyndrome\u2014\nnow formally called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic \nfatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)\u2014includes fatigue at a level \nthat diminishes the patient\u2019s functional status, exists for \n6\u00a0months or longer, and is associated with four or more of \nthe following clinical symptoms: (1) poor concentration \nand memory; (2) sleep that does not provide a sense of \nrefreshment; (3) severe post-exercise malaise; (4) muscle \nand joint pain; and (5) signs of illness such as sore throat, \nheadache, and tender lymph nodes (CDC, 2012; Fukuda \net\u00a0al., 1994). In children, however, ME/CFS symptoms \noften differ from the standard syndrome in adults, and may \ninclude abdominal pain and rashes; symptoms in children \nalso vary more on a day-to-day basis compared to symptoms \nin adults (Jason, Barker, & Brown, 2012). To be formally \ndiagnosed with ME/CFS, children must meet the standard \ncriteria for adults as well as exhibit additional symptoms \nsuch as two or more neurocognitive manifestations and \nat least one of the following: autonomic manifestations, \nneuroendocrine manifestations, or immune manifestations \n(Jason et\u00a0al., 2012; Jason et\u00a0al., 2006).\nAssessment of Fatigue\nThe pediatric nurse has the challenge of assessing the de\u00ad\ngree or severity of a child\u2019s fatigue experience.

Unfortunately, for some children, \ntheir fatigue experience may not have a medical treatment.\nNursing Care for Fatigue\nImplementing holistic practices when providing support to a \nchild and his or her family is essential. After a comprehensive \nhealth history and assessment, the nurse should assist the \nchild to balance energy expenditures with rest and energy \nconservation. Attaining and maintaining adequate nutrition, \nhydration, sleep patterns, exercise, and play/recreation op\u00ad\nportunities should be the focus of nursing care. Understand\u00ad\ning the underlying cause of the fatigue, such as electrolyte \nimbalances, malnutrition, anemia, mental health disorders, \npain, or poor sleep quality, will allow for the development \nof a unique and individualized nursing care plan.\nDyspnea\nThe symptoms of dyspnea can be very frightening and un\u00ad\ncomfortable. Feeling breathless, feeling as though one cannot \n\t\nDyspnea\t\n147\n", "management, learning disabilities, mood disorders, anxiety \ndisorders, depression, and emotional lability (Anders & \nEigen, 1997; Angriman, Cortese, & Bruni, 2016; Hedger \nArchbold, Pituch, Panahi, & Chervin, 2002; Dahl, 1996; \nStanford Health Care, 2015).\nSleep disorders can be classified into two distinct \ncategories. Dyssomnias involve difficulty initiating or \nmaintaining sleep; they include sleep-onset problems, \ninadequate total sleep hours, poor sleep hygiene, sleep \napnea, and significant snoring. Parasomnias involve dif\u00ad\nficulty with the sleep\u2013wake transition; in these disorders, \nthe child experiences nightmares, sleepwalking, night \nterrors, or abnormal motor movements. Other condi\u00ad\ntions such as cataplexy (sudden weakening of muscles \nassociated with narcolepsy) and automatic behavior \nsymptoms (being half-asleep, then waking up with no \nmemory of activities performed during this time) can be \nassociated with narcolepsy, a condition characterized by \na reduced quantity of hypocretin in the brain (Stanford \nHealth Care, 2015).\nAssessment of Sleep Disturbances\nThe pediatric healthcare team should conduct a thorough \nassessment of children who demonstrate signs and symptoms \nsteroids, diuretics, antibiotics, and suctioning. The child \nshould be placed in a position of comfort that also maxi\u00ad\nmizes respiratory function and chest expansion. The child \nmay desire to sit straight up or maintain a leaning-forward \nstance. Diagnostics may be ordered to determine the eti\u00ad\nology of the dyspnea before further medical treatments \nare initiated.\nNursing Care for Dyspnea\nThe child experiencing significant dyspnea may feel pan\u00ad\nicky. In fact, both the child and the family may be quite \nfrightened. The child will benefit from a calm and trusting \nrelationship with the pediatric nurse who focuses atten\u00ad\ntion on immediate assessment, relaxation, and symptom \nresolution. Providing support, medical treatments, and \nnursing interventions for dyspnea will allow the child to \ncalm down and feel less anxious.\nWhile medical management is under way, the pediatric \nnurse can gently rub the child\u2019s arm, stroke the child\u2019s back \ngently, and provide appropriate distraction. Being pres\u00ad\nent and communicating that the team is here to help and \ninterventions are under way may be powerfully soothing \nto the frightened child.\nSleep Disturbances\nA variety of circumstances can cause a child to experience \nsleep disturbances\u2014that is, conditions that impair the \nability to sleep well on a regular basis (Table 11-4). If a \nchild is experiencing any of the other symptoms discussed \nearlier in this chapter, it is very likely that the child will \nalso have disrupted sleep or poor sleep quality. Discom\u00ad\nfort, fatigue, dyspnea, nausea, and emotional distress can \nall influence how well a child falls asleep and stays asleep. \nMany medications can influence sleep, and most conditions \nfor which a child would be hospitalized or seek health\u00ad\ncare services have the potential to influence sleep quality. \nChildren with sleep disorders, or those often associated \nwith pathologies, are at risk for further health detriments. \nFor example, academic performance is closely tied to the \nquality and quantity of a child\u2019s sleep (Abraham & Scaria, \n2015; Diaz et\u00a0al., 2016). Children with sleep disturbances \nare more prone to accidents, injuries, behavioral issues, \nmood disorders, memory problems, and overall learning \ndifficulties (Berger, Miller, Seifer, Cares, & LeBourgeois, \n2012; Boto et\u00a0al., 2012).\nResearch has shown that children who have sleep \ndisorders also have significant behavioral and medical \nmorbidity. The most concerning morbidities relate to severe \nsleep-disordered breathing, including arrhythmias, heart \nfailure, and even death. Milder sleep disorders have been \nassociated with lower cognitive functioning, poor weight \nTABLE 11-4\u2003\nTypes or Causes of Sleep Disturbances in Children\n\u203a\u203a\nInsomnia\n\u203a\u203a\nSleep terrors\n\u203a\u203a\nSleep walking\n\u203a\u203a\nSleep deprivation over time\n\u203a\u203a\nPain or discomfort\n\u203a\u203a\nFear\n\u203a\u203a\nBedtime resistance\n\u203a\u203a\nInfectious respiratory conditions\n\u203a\u203a\nNon-infectious respiratory conditions such as asthma \nand chronic bronchitis\n\u203a\u203a\nObstructive sleep apnea and/or snoring (e.g., due to \nenlarged tonsils or adenoids)\n\u203a\u203a\nHeadaches\n\u203a\u203a\nDifficulty falling back to sleep\n\u203a\u203a\nMental health issues\n\u203a\u203a\nAutistic spectrum disorders\n\u203a\u203a\nObesity\n\u203a\u203a\nRestless leg syndrome\n\u203a\u203a\nCo-sleeping or communal sleeping quarters\n148\t\nChapter 11\u2003 Symptom Management Across Childhood\n", "Nursing Care for Sleep Disturbances\nPediatric nurses are in an excellent position to educate \nchildren and families about proper sleep hygiene (good \nsleep habits). The entire family should become aware of the \ndetrimental effects of poor sleep quality and quantity. Sug\u00ad\ngestions for improving a child\u2019s sleep include the following:\n\u2022\t Reevaluate the child\u2019s sleep arrangements. Remove \nany stimuli that could delay bedtime or wake the \nchild during the night. There should be no TV in \nthe child\u2019s room, and the family should set and en\u00ad\nforce rules concerning screen time in the evening. \nMusic should not be played during a child\u2019s sleep \ntime. Cell phones, computers, and laptops should \nbe turned off or removed from the child\u2019s room.\n\u2022\t Assess the lighting in the child\u2019s room. Make \nsure the room is dark, but provide a nightlight if \nrequested.\n\u2022\t Create a comforting, relaxing, and anticipated \n\u00adbedtime ritual. This ritual may take as long as 15 to \n60 minutes. A young child could be quietly read to; \nan older child could be given the opportunity to lie \nin bed and talk about his or her day.\n\u2022\t Use relaxation breathing techniques, guided imag\u00ad\nery, or other forms of relaxation while in bed.\n\u2022\t Do not allow a child to have caffeinated beverages \nin the evening. Avoid large meals close to bedtime.\n\u2022\t Insist on the child sleeping in his or her own bed. If \nthe child has been allowed to fall asleep in another \nbed, on the couch, or elsewhere, break this habit by \nsetting limits, being assertive, and being consistent.\n\u2022\t Consider naturopathic sleep aids such as melatonin \nsupplements, chamomile tea, lemon balm, and lav\u00ad\nender oil or a lavender sleep sachet. A warm bath \nbefore bedtime can be very soothing.\n\u2022\t Take into account the child\u2019s developmental stage. \nFor instance, an infant should not be allowed to \nfall asleep in the parent\u2019s arms, but rather should \nbe placed in the crib when demonstrating sleepi\u00ad\nness. Toddlers may need rigid bedtime rituals and \nhave great trouble falling to sleep if the ritual is \nof, or report, sleep disturbances. Ask the child or caregiver \nthe following questions:\n1.\t How many hours of sleep does the child average per \nnight? What hour is the child\u2019s bedtime? Does the \nchild consistently go to bed at this hour?\n2.\t Which activities does the child participate in during \nevening hours and right before bed?\n3.\t Which current health issues does the child have? \nIs there a documented mental health or cognitive \nhealth concern?\n4.\t Does the child have difficulty falling asleep? Stay\u00ad\ning asleep? Going back to sleep once awake during \nthe night?\n5.\t Does the child sleep during the day or take naps?\u00a0Does \nthe child fall asleep during the day?\n6.\t Does the child snore? Does the child have any acute \nor chronic airway health issues?\n7.\t How would you describe the environment in which \nthe child typically sleeps?\n8.\t Are you aware of any stressors or emotional issues \nfacing the child at this time, such as bullying, home\u00ad\nwork issues, or social issues of concern?\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nI\nn the 1038 children studied in two pediatric clinics by Hedger \nArchbold, Pituch, Panahi, and Chervin (2002), sleep problems \nwere found to be associated with a number of intrinsic factors. \nIn particular, sleep-disordered breathing (11%), habitual \nsnoring (17%), non-infectious respiratory conditions (21%), \nand insomnia (41%) were reported as causing a child to have \nsignificant sleep disturbances.\nNursing Diagnoses for Sleep Disturbances\nNursing diagnoses for children with sleep disturbances \ninclude insomnia and sleep pattern disturbance.\nMedical Treatments for Sleep Disturbances\nMedical treatment for children with sleep disturbances \ntypically depends on the underlying pathology, emotional \nproblems, stressors, or mental health issues. Sleep evalu\u00ad\nation, evaluation by an ear/nose/throat (ENT) specialist, \nand sleep apnea assessment may be suggested. Only rarely \nare children prescribed or offered sleeping pills\u2014though \nmelatonin has been used successfully in the treatment of \nsleep disturbances in children, especially those with chronic \ninsomnia (Paavonen, 2004). Most medical treatment plans \nfor children with sleep disturbances include behavioral \nmodification, positive reinforcement, limits setting, sleep \nexpectations setting, and, if needed, psychological evalu\u00ad\nation, counseling, and referral to a sleep specialist.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nS\nleep terrors, which most commonly occur in the preschool \ndevelopmental stage, may cause a child to wake up during \nthe night in a state of screaming. Sleepwalking, associated with \nolder developmental stages and rarely found in toddlers or \npreschool children, causes a child to have episodes of walking \nduring the night. These episodes have been correlated with \ndisrupted, disturbed, and shortened sleep hours (Mindel & \nOwens, 2015).\n\t\nSleep Disturbances\t\n149\n", "the enzyme that converts codeine into its active form of \nmorphine (Williams, Hatch, & Howard, 2011).\nLanguage barriers have been shown to be responsible \nfor parents of children under-reporting and even misin\u00ad\nterpreting their child\u2019s pain (Weiner, McConnell, Latella, & \nLudi, 2013). Fear of the authority associated with licensed \nhealthcare providers, called power distance, can influence \nwhether a family reports their child\u2019s health condition \nor symptoms. Cultural influences may also affect sleep \ndisturbances, as in situations where co-sleeping or com\u00ad\nmunal sleeping quarters, or practices regarding the use of \nswings and breastfeeding to soothe infants, are a cultural \nvalue (Anuntaseree et\u00a0al., 2008).\nAnother misconception by healthcare workers encoun\u00ad\ntering patients from different cultures is the assumption \nthat all people from the same culture are the same in their \nbeliefs, values, cultural expressions, and cultural behaviors, \nand that cultural customs regarding pain expressions and \nmanagement are superficial and frivolous. Results from a \n2012 study showed that patients who were non-white had \nsignificantly lower pain scores documented than patients \nwho were white (Ortega, Velden, Lin, & Reid, 2012). Mis\u00ad\ntakes based on cultural misunderstandings can negatively \nimpact communication, compliance, adherence, satisfac\u00ad\ntion, and, ultimately, adequate pain control in the pediatric \npopulation. Nurses must be vigilant about learning and \nunderstanding how cultural factors influence symptom \nexperiences in their pediatric patients.\nnot followed or is shortened for convenience. Pre\u00ad\nschoolers may verbalize fears of the dark, presence \nof monsters, or ghosts. They should be allowed to \nexpress themselves and shown that no such entity is \nphysically present. School-aged children and teens \nmay sneak social media and conversations with \nfriends before bedtime.\n\u2022\t Talk to the child about the importance of sleep. \nTeach the child about the detrimental factors \n\u00adassociated with sleep disturbances. Praise the \nchild\u00a0for participating in efforts to improve his or \nher sleep.\nCultural Influences on Symptom \nManagement\nMuch research has addressed the behaviors, values, faith, \npreferences, and customs of different cultures. Within \nthe multicultural healthcare environment, it is helpful for \nmembers of the pediatric healthcare team to understand \nthat culture can influence both a child\u2019s expressions of \npain and other symptoms and the culturally acceptable \ninterventions for symptom management. For instance, \ndrug metabolism may differ in people of certain\u00a0ethnici\u00ad\nties, such that some individuals may experience more pain \nbecause pain-relieving drugs wear off more quickly than in \npersons of other ethnicities. As an example, 30% of Hong \nKong Chinese, 9% of Europeans, and 1% of Arabs lack \nCase Study\nA 3-month-old infant was admitted to the pediatric unit with \na 2-day history of fever. The mother had an uncomplicated \nvaginal delivery and did not present with any evidence of \nillness at the time of her delivery or subsequently. The child \nwas admitted through the emergency department (ED). \nBlood cultures, urine cultures, lumbar puncture, and nasal \nswab for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A \nand B were all performed in the ED prior to the patient\u2019s \nadmission to the pediatric unit. The hospitalist conducted a \nthorough assessment of the infant and determined that that \nchild had clinical signs of meningitis, including mild nuchal \nrigidity and evidence of headache and neck discomfort. \nThe infant has been settled into her room, both parents are \npresent and are tearful, and the infant is now on contact and \ndroplet precautions.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t Considering the infant\u2019s age and developmental stage, \nwhich pain assessment tools would be appropriate for \nthe nurse to use?\n2.\t Of the various types of pain, which would the nurse \nsuspect the infant is experiencing?\n3.\t What education can be provided to the family to sup\u00ad\nport the child\u2019s pain assessments, management, and \nevaluation?\n(continues)\n150\t\nChapter 11\u2003 Symptom Management Across Childhood\n", "Chapter Summary\n\u25c6\u25c6Symptom management is part of the holistic role of the \nnurse across all healthcare settings.\n\u25c6\u25c6Untreated symptoms, such as pain, discomfort, fatigue, \nnausea, dyspnea, and sleep disturbances, can have severe \nconsequences for a child\u2019s social, emotional, develop\u00ad\nmental, academic, and home life.\n\u25c6\u25c6The experience of pain is unique for each patient.\n\u25c6\u25c6Nurses must address pain assessment and pain manage\u00ad\nment to prevent undertreatment of pain.

Various models of familial stress have \nbeen proposed, including models focusing on the impact of \neconomic factors on family coping (e.g., the Family Stress \nModel developed by Conger et\u00a0al. [2002]); models address\u00ad\ning the family\u2019s ability to adjust and adapt to stress (e.g., the \nFAAR model developed by Patterson [1988]); and social\u2012\u00ad\necological models that look at individuals in the context of \ntheir immediate relationships, the community, and society \nas a whole (CDC, 2015b). These models all offer perspectives \nthat nurses can use in their assessment of families under stress.\nWith the current demands placed on families, it is not \nuncommon to have a family under stress while in the care \nof a pediatric healthcare team. Regardless of the clinical \nsetting, a family can present with situational stress from \nthe child\u2019s current illness or injury, or family members be \nexperiencing many stressors (i.e., stimuli that create stress) \nassociated with the family\u2019s life and society\u2019s demands.\nMyriad causes of stress exist in contemporary society. \nSome stressors relate to the chaos of daily life, especially \nwhen a family is trying to juggle the demands of work, \nhome, school, child care, traffic, and commutes (American \nPsychological Association [APA], 2010). Other common fam\u00ad\nily stressors include marital relationships, childrearing and \ndiscipline, health issues, elder care, and finances. Individual \nfamily members may also experience stress from personal \nconcerns. With the current rates of unemployment, debt, \nsubstance abuse, domestic violence, and crime, it is not \nuncommon to encounter family groups or individual family \nmembers experiencing significant stress that affects their \nability to balance life\u2019s demands (Figure 12-1). The caregiver \nof a child\u2014be it a parent, grandparent, or guardian\u2014may \npresent with severe stress symptoms requiring intervention; \nthe child may, in turn, identify with the caregiver\u2019s stress \nand experience secondary stress as a result (APA, 2010).\nThis chapter provides guidelines for assisting a family that \nis experiencing stress. Stress-related tools and assessments are \ndescribed, as well as interventions and communication tips \nto assist in working with a family under stress (Figure 12-2).\nDefinitions of Stress\nThe experience of stress is inevitable for all people, re\u00ad\ngardless of age. Although daily life can bring numerous \nchallenges, the physiological reaction known as stress is \nfelt when the challenges experienced exceed one\u2019s ability \nto control and manage one\u2019s environment. When stress is \nnot managed or becomes chronic, it turns into distress, \n156\t\nChapter 12\u2003 Caring for Families Under Stress\n", "Recognizing Stress in Families \nand\u00a0Individuals\nA certain amount of stress experienced by families is in\u00ad\nevitable. When a child is ill or injured, however, a family\u2019s \nstress level can increase exponentially. The pediatric nurse \nmust realize that stress will inevitably happen, so it is how \nthe family and each family member handle stress that is \ncritically important. The various models of family stress \ncan offer different perspectives on causes of stress and as\u00ad\nsist the nurse in identifying underlying issues and offering \nstrategies for reducing them or improving coping\u2014that is, \nskills for handling stressful events, stressful circumstances, \nand stressors. Both individual family members and the \nfamily as a whole must develop effective coping skills.\na condition in which one feels the effect of stress beyond \nemotional reactions and the body begins to respond to \nthe stressful stimuli.\nStress is generally defined as a three-step process: \n(1)\u00a0the encounter of a stressful stimulus, (2) a response \nto that stressful stimulus, and (3) the process of ad\u00ad\njustment and interactions between the person feeling \nstress and the stressful stimuli. Stress provokes a series \nof responses\u2014developmental, neurochemical, and \nemotional. Although some stress is normal, excessive \nstress is detrimental to one\u2019s health, both in the short \nand long terms (Felitti, 2009; Felitti et\u00a0al., 1998; Gilbert \net\u00a0al., 2015).\nStress can provoke the adrenal glands to release certain \nneurochemicals (stress hormones), which cause a number \nof physiological symptoms. During periods of significant \nstress, the body releases epinephrine and norepinephrine \nfrom the adrenal medulla (the inner portion of the adrenal \ngland), as well as cortisol from the adrenal cortex (the outer \nportion of the adrenal gland). The release of these stress \nhormones leads to the following symptoms:\n\u2022\t Tachycardia\n\u2022\t Tachypnea\n\u2022\t Vasoconstriction\n\u2022\t Elevated blood pressure\n\u2022\t Muscle tension (when prolonged, it can lead to ten\u00ad\nsion headaches)\n\u2022\t Clammy hands\n\u2022\t Gastrointestinal disturbances\nStress can be classified into three major types:\n\u2022\t Positive stress\u2014for example, when a child encoun\u00ad\nters a new experience, but it brings few or only \nminor changes in emotions, hormonal response, or \nheart rate change\n\u2022\t Tolerable stress\u2014for example, when a child has a \nmore intense experience such as a family death or \nan accident and the child adapts\n\u2022\t Toxic stress\u2014where the stressor is severe, intense. \nand sustained, leading to a prolonged stress activa\u00ad\ntion (e.g., physical or sexual abuse, or witnessing \nabuse of the child\u2019s parent)\nFindings from the Adverse Childhood Experiences \n(ACE) study suggest that toxic stress causes profound \nalterations in brain structure and functioning, particularly \nif the events occur during the developmental period (Anda \net\u00a0al., 2006). This kind of stress affects immune system \nfunction and reduces learning and memory, leading to \ncognitive deficits and impairment (DeBellis & Zisk, 2014). \nProlonged and toxic levels of stress have been known to \ndamage a child\u2019s hippocampus\u2014the part of the brain \nwhere memory, learning, and cognitive processing occur \n(Audage\u00a0& Middlebrooks, 2008).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nO\nften, children across the developmental period will model \ntheir parents\u2019 behaviors. This modeling can include be\u00ad\nhaviors related to managing stress\u2014both healthy coping \nbehaviors and unhealthy coping behaviors. If parents deal \nwith stress in unhealthy ways such as overeating, engaging \nin substance use, and performing other high-risk behaviors, \nthey may inadvertently encourage those behaviors in their \nchildren. Conversely, parents who cope with stress in healthy \nways can promote better adjustment and happiness for the \nentire family. Parents need anticipatory guidance that children \nwatch and listen to their parents and often model their own \ndecisions and behaviors after those of their role models.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nT\nhe American Psychological Association (2010) conducted \nan online survey of families, in conjunction with Harris \nInteractive, and found that obese parents are much more \nlikely than those who are within a normal weight range to \nhave children who are obese. The researchers discovered \nthat overweight children are more likely than normal-weight \nchildren to report that their parents are often worried \nand stressed. These research findings can help pediatric \nhealthcare teams assist families who have weight issues to \nidentify stressors and seek appropriate means to identify \nstress, reduce stress, and participate in healthy eating and \nincreased physical activity.\nReactions to stress may differ in each of the developmental \nstages (Cohen, 2002). Infants demonstrate stress by being \nirritable, becoming fearful, and demonstrating increased \ncrying and gastrointestinal distress. Children younger than \n\t\nRecognizing Stress in Families and\u00a0Individuals\t\n157\n", "Figure 12-3\u2002 Nursing interventions to reduce the impact of traumatic \nevents can include teaching self-soothing techniques such as meditation.\n\u00a9 Pinkcandy/Shutterstock\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS \nA\nccording to the U.S Department of Health and Human \nServices (Audage & Middlebrooks, 2008), children who \nexperience prolonged stress, but lack the ability to cope with \nthat stress, can experience significant short-term and long-\nterm health effects. Notably, childhood stress has been linked \nto alcoholism, eating disorders, heart disease, depression, and \nother chronic disorders later in life.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nT\nhe two most common reactions to stress encountered in \nchildren are regression of behavior to a lower developmental \nperiod or stage and a change in behavior recognizable to the \nchild\u2019s parents or significant adults in their lives (DeBord, 2014).\nSymptoms of Stress\nStress is the body\u2019s reaction to harmful situations, ei\u00ad\nther real or perceived. Written in 1956, Hans Selye\u2019s \ngeneral adaptation syndrome (GAS) theory describes \nthe stress response of an organism as occurring in three \nstages (Szabo, Tache\u00a0& Somogyi, 2012). In the first \nstage,\u00a0known as \u201calarm,\u201d the body\u2019s physiology changes \nas the body attempts to mobilize to compensate for the \nstressful event (the \u201cflight or fight\u201d response). This first \nstage is considered the arousal stage, as the body releases \nhormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol) \ninto the bloodstream. In the second stage, known as \n\u201cresistance,\u201d the body continues to compensate at peak \ncapacity as it tries to adapt to the stressor. The final \nstage, \u201cexhaustion,\u201d causes the body\u2019s natural defenses to \nbreak down, such that the body becomes susceptible to \nillness, tissue damage, ulcers, high blood pressure, and \nchronic health conditions directly linked to an impaired \nimmune function.\nSymptoms of stress may vary widely for individual \nfamily members according to the type and duration of \nexposure to a stressor or multiple stressors. Although \nstressors for children can be very different than the \nstressors experienced by adult family members, the \nimpact of stress can nonetheless be damaging to the \nbody and mind. Prolonged or chronic stress can lead \ndirectly to illness. Individuals under severe or chronic \nstress may report or display some of the following \nconditions (APA, 2016; CDC, 2015b; Dufton, Dunn, \nSlosky,\u00a0& Compas, 2011).\n\u2022\t Fight-or-flight responses of tachycardia, tachypnea, \ntight muscles, headaches, and increased blood \npressure\n\u2022\t Feelings of fatigue and low energy\n\u2022\t Emotional reactions such as crying, anger, sadness, \nfrustration, helplessness, tension, and irritability\n\u2022\t Difficulty making decisions or having clear think\u00ad\ning processes\n\u2022\t Difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, insom\u00ad\nnia, hypersomnia (especially in adolescents), and \nbizarre and disturbing dreams\n\u2022\t Jaw pain, tooth pain, and grinding of teeth\n\u2022\t Hair loss\n\u2022\t Intestinal disturbances such as abdominal pain, \nnausea, diarrhea, and constipation\n\u2022\t Menstrual cramps and difficult menstrual periods\n\u2022\t Muscle twitching, aches, muscle and nerve pains, \nand eyelid spasms\n\u2022\t Acne development and other cutaneous reac\u00ad\ntions to stress, including rashes and areas of \ninflammation\nage 3 may react to stress by being aggressive or demonstrat\u00ad\ning regressive behaviors. Children in the preschool period \nmay show stress by acting out, being fearful of separation or \nabandonment, and having increased nightmares. School-age \nchildren will manifest stress by poor school performance, \naggression, and increased acting-out behaviors. Adolescents \nwho experience significant stress can exhibit poor self-\nesteem, delinquency, high-risk behaviors, and problems in \nrelationships. Knowing the relationship between the various \ndevelopmental stages and the expression of stress can assist \na pediatric nurse in anticipating behaviors and intervening \nrapidly. For example, nursing interventions to reduce the \nimpact of traumatic events can include teaching coping \nskills or self-soothing techniques such as meditation or \ntherapeutic play, guiding parent\u2012child dialogue in reviewing \nthe traumatic incident, or advocating to correct problematic \nor unsafe practices (Mulvihill, 2007) (Figure 12-3).\n158\t\nChapter 12\u2003 Caring for Families Under Stress\n", "In contrast, less stressed families seem to find time to \nenjoy and support one another, display more flexibility, have \nreasonable expectations, communicate regularly with one \nanother, set priorities, and view stress as a challenge that \nis both temporary and controllable. As a pediatric nurse, \nit is important to communicate to families that it is never \ntoo late to learn effective coping strategies (APA, 2015).\n\u2022\t Physiologic or somatic responses such as recurrent \nstomachache or headache\n\u2022\t Development of colds and other common viral in\u00ad\nfections associated with a lower immune response \n(i.e., lowered immune system response)\n\u2022\t Changes in weight\u2014weight loss or weight gain\n\u2022\t In situations of severe, chronic, long-term stress, \ndevelopment of a chronic illness such as asthma, \ndiabetes, hypertension, and arthritis\nThe family unit may be experiencing stress due to daily \ndemands (APA, 2010; Walsh, 2013).

When a person with limited \ncoping abilities becomes emotionally distressed, anger can \nsurface. Fear, harm to other people and property, personal \ninjury, feeling persecuted, perceiving a loss, shock, denial, \nand guilt are all human responses to stress. \nWhen a child, parent, or any adult in a healthcare environ\u00ad\nment begins to display hostile or aggressive behaviors, the \npediatric healthcare team must mobilize to work together to \nhandle the situation before harm occurs. A single healthcare \nprofessional should never try to handle a hostile, aggressive, \nand potentially violent person on his or her own, and use \nof a third person not initially involved in the confrontation \ncan often help de-escalate the situation (Su, 2010). Keeping \ncalm, keeping a safe distance, respectfully acknowledging the \nemotions, suspending personal responses, being supportive, \nand using a quiet and soothing voice while offering help \ncan potentially diffuse the escalating hostility (Richmond \net\u00a0al., 2012; Sheldon & Foust, 2014). \nCare teams should practice how to respond to these kinds \nof scenarios via simulated hostile, aggressive, and violent \npatient situations. Knowing how to maintain personal safety \nand safety of others, as well as practicing how to interact \nwith a hostile person, can keep a team ready to respond. In \naddition, knowing how to call for help from the institutional \nsecurity department or a response team is imperative for \nmaintaining a safe environment for staff, patients, and families.\nInterventions for Stress\nThe role of the pediatric nurse for families experiencing \nstress centers on securing a state of immediate safety. If a \nfamily in stress presents to a pediatric healthcare setting, \nthe primary assessment should include an immediate \nsweep for safety and health concerns; if any are present, \nthe safety concerns should be minimized. For instance, \nif a family and child presents with evidence of trauma, \nviolence, current drug or alcohol use, or severe neglect \nor abuse, the team\u2019s focus would be on securing a safe \n\t\nInterventions for Stress\t\n159\n", "Figure 12-5\u2002 Ideas for adults to help children cope with stress include \nspending time holding a child in a soothing way.\n\u00a9 szefei/Shutterstock\nResources for Stress\nThe pediatric healthcare team should provide information \nand referrals if a family unit, individual members, or a child \nis experiencing continued stress and poor health or behav\u00ad\nioral outcomes due to the stress experience.

Applying the principles of family-centered \ncare (FCC) can provide a structure of support by focusing \nenvironment for the child. Once the child is in a state of \nsafety, the next priority would be to assess the severity \nand symptoms of the child\u2019s and family\u2019s stress and then \nprovide interventions.\nNurses should work directly with parents or guardians, \nif appropriate, to provide a child with support to help the \nchild cope. According to the CDC (2015a) and Kidshealth.\norg (2015), ideas for adults to help children cope with stress \ninclude the following:\n\u2022\t Ensure the child\u2019s safety, and emphasize to the child \nthat steps are being taken for this purpose.\n\u2022\t Acknowledge that the child seems bothered by \nsomething by expressing concern and stating that \nyou want to help the child.\n\u2022\t Listen carefully to the concern expressed by the child \nand restate the perceived emotion or concern back \nto the child to ensure clarity of the issue at hand.\n\u2022\t Encourage children to talk, draw, or engage in play \nto express their fears or concerns, and provide un\u00ad\nderstanding and reassurance in response to these \nexpressions.\n\u2022\t Monitor for concerning behaviors and promote \nhealthy behaviors.\n\u2022\t Promote self care and connecting with others.\n\u2022\t Help a child maintain his or her normal routine in \nterms of sleep, eating, school attendance, chores, \nand participation in social events or after-school \nactivities.\n\u2022\t Help the child find ways to cope by talking together \nabout ideas to reduce the stressful event or situation.\n\u2022\t Spend time with the child in play, sports, long \nwalks, or cuddling on the couch (Figure 12-5).\n\u2022\t Seek resources and referrals for psychological sup\u00ad\nport and interventions if needed.\nBEST PRACTICES\nW\nhen families are experiencing multiple stressors to the \npoint of feeling overwhelmed, working with trusted \nfriends, family members, healthcare providers, clergy, and \ncounselors can be quite helpful. The following five ideas may \npromote a healthier approach to stressful circumstances:\n\u2022\t Evaluate the source or cause of the stress. Who is it \naffecting\u2014the entire family or individuals?\n\u2022\t Evaluate one\u2019s lifestyle. Is it healthy and balanced, or \ndoes it produce feelings of being overwhelmed?\n\u2022\t Talk to others, including extended family mem\u00ad\nbers, friends, clergy, counselors, or mental health \nprofessionals.\n\u2022\t Create healthy behaviors, including quality sleep \nbehaviors, healthy eating behaviors, and laughter.\n\u2022\t Make healthy choices and encourage other family \nmembers to join in.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nA\nccording to the American Psychological Association (2015), \nfamily members who do not deny or avoid dealing with \nstress, but rather acknowledge a child\u2019s stress, take action on \nthe source of the stress, and zero in on the problem, tend to \nreport lower levels of depression and anxiety. \n160\t\nChapter 12\u2003 Caring for Families Under Stress\n", "provide health information at the level of complexity that \nis understood, can also assist in reducing stress.\nCaring for the holistic healthcare needs of the child is \na paramount concern for the pediatric nurse. Providing \nopportunities for rest, relaxation, play, medical play, nutri\u00ad\ntion, pain management, and sibling involvement can help \na child through a stressful health encounter.\non the promotion of well-being. Within the philosophy \nof family-centered care, one premise is that the family is \na constant in the child\u2019s life (Neal, Frost, Kuhn, Green, & \nGance-Cleveland, 2007). Families should be informed of \nthe status of their child\u2019s health as well as all treatment deci\u00ad\nsions, interventions, and short- or long-term plans. Includ\u00ad\ning the family in change-of-shift reports, walking rounds, \npatient conferences, and treatment decisions may reduce \nthe stress felt when a child is hospitalized. Incorporating \nthe FCC principles of empowerment and enabling may also \nreduce the stress felt by family members. Bear in mind that \nchildren observe and respond to stress in their parents and \nother family members, so addressing caregivers\u2019 stress will, \nin turn, have an impact on the child\u2019s stress level.\nEnsuring consistent, supportive, and clear commu\u00ad\nnication; answering all of the family\u2019s questions; and \nproviding culturally sensitive care are other measures \nthat may help reduce a family\u2019s stress. When parents are \nengaged in collaboration with the healthcare team and \nare supported in helping their child cope with illness, \ninjury, and hospitalization, the parent\u2013child relationship \ndeepens (Saleeba, 2008). Making sure that all healthcare \nteam members understand the health literacy level of the \nfamily members (and the primary decision maker), and \nPHARMACOLOGY\nT\nhe state of being hospitalized and having an injury, \nillness, or surgical procedure can cause significant stress for \nchildren. In fact, children who experience a serious medical \ncondition may develop a peptic stress ulcer secondary to their \ncondition (Revelz, Guerrero-Lozano, Camacho, Yara,\u00a0& Mosquera, \n2010). Despite limited evidence supporting this practice, many \nprimary care providers choose to order the use of prophylactic \nantiulcer medications, such as histamine blockers for acid sup\u00ad\npression, to prevent a child from developing an ulcer (Kliegman, \nStanton, St. Geme, & Schor, 2016). Oral stress ulcer-prevention \nmedications such as Prilosec (omeprazole), Protonix (pantopra\u00ad\nzole), Prevacid (lansoprazole), Pepcid (famotidine), and Zantac \n(ranitidine) may be ordered for this purpose.\nCase Study\nA family of five has been living in their car in the San Francisco \nBay area for the last year. The oldest child, a 10-year-old boy, \nsuffers from the effects of cold weather, stress, and poor nu\u00ad\ntrition. This child has been experiencing frequent and severe \nasthma attacks that have required two emergency room visits \nand one hospitalization in the last 6 months. During the current \nemergency room visit, the pediatric healthcare team identifies a \ndirect relationship between the cold weather and the patient\u2019s \nasthma exacerbations. While discussing their concerns with \nthe parents, the family appears very distraught and the mother \nis tearful while she holds her youngest child, a 2-year-old girl.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t Homelessness affected 1.5 million children in the United \nStates in 2010 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser\u00ad\nvices Administration, 2015).

Common \nsymptoms include fight-or-flight responses, fatigue \nand low energy, emotional reactions, difficulty making \ndecisions, sleep disturbances, intestinal disturbances, \nchanges in weight and eating habits, and acute or chronic \nhealth conditions.\n\u25c6\u25c6Hans Selye\u2019s general adaptation syndrome theory describes \nthe stress response of an organism as occurring in three \nstages: \u201cfight or flight,\u201d \u201cresistance,\u201d and \u201cexhaustion.\u201d \nDuring the stress response, the body\u2019s natural defenses \nbreak down, such that the body becomes susceptible to \nillness, tissue damage, ulcers, high blood pressure, and \nchronic health conditions directly linked to an impaired \nimmune function.\n\u25c6\u25c6The pediatric nurse and other members of the pediatric \nhealthcare team should work together to identify stress \nin families and children.

Less extreme examples \ninclude the debate over corporal punishment, such as \nspanking or \u201cwhipping\u201d a child with a stick or belt; this \npractice is considered acceptable among some groups, but \nhas been found by numerous studies to carry long-term \npsychological impacts for the child (Gershoff, 2013).\nOne challenge for pediatric healthcare professionals \nis to determine which child discipline and childrearing \npractices are concerning, neglectful, or abusive. The Child \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), originally \nsigned into law in 1974 and since reauthorized, defines \nchild abuse as \u201cany recent act or failure to act on the part \nof a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious \nphysical or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or exploitation, \nor an act or failure to act which presents an imminent \nrisk of serious harm\u201d (National Child Abuse and Neglect \nTraining and Publications Project, 2014).\nFurther challenges for healthcare professionals include \ndetermining the seriousness of the injury. For instance, \nbruising, a very typical childhood condition, is considered \nvery normal and is frequently associated with active play \nand exploration. A challenge for healthcare professionals is \nto determine at what point should bruising be considered \nabuse. A typical bruise is red, purple, blueish, black, or yellow \nas the area of blood vessel trauma is healing. The evaluation \nof an area of cutaneous trauma should include the child\u2019s \nage, medical history, developmental level, and, most impor\u00ad\ntantly, the stated history or circumstances surrounding the \nbruise. For instance, a bruise in a child under 9 months of \nage, located on soft tissue not associated with a bony promi\u00ad\nnence, under the eyes, on the neck or trunk, or in various \nstages of healing should raise suspicion (Tomkia, 2010).\nUnrealistic parental expectations of a child and the inability \nof a child to behave in a developmentally inappropriate way \nor conform to the parents\u2019 wishes have both been shown to \nIntroduction\nChild maltreatment is a widespread and complex social issue \nthat remains one of the greatest social concerns across the \nworld. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC, 2016b), child maltreatment comprises \n\u201cany act or series of acts of commission or omission by a \nparent or other caregiver (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher) that \nresults in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a \nchild.\u201d Child abuse crosses all cultures, races, ethnicities, \nreligions, socioeconomic statuses, parental age groups, \nindividuals with or without previous parenting experience, \nand geographic locations. Considered highly detrimental \nto the development and well-being of a child, the many \nforms of maltreatment can have lifelong consequences.\nMembers of the pediatric healthcare team are in a unique \nposition to identify abuse and, therefore, provide a safety net \nfor the child. A child might enter the healthcare environment \nfor treatment of abuse-related sequelae, such as an infection \nsuperimposed on an intentional burn, or gastrointestinal upset \nfrom poisoning; or the child might enter for an unrelated \nreason, such as pneumonia, where lung radiographs identify \nbroken ribs in various stages of healing. Regardless of the \nchild\u2019s age, gender, race, culture, social status, or location, \nhealthcare providers must be aware of the signs of abuse and \nknow what to do to provide safety to the child (Figure 13-1).\nPediatric nurses have enormous responsibilities as front-\nline caregivers who often are the first to suspect a child has \nbeen abused. Because the pediatric nurse spends the most \ntime with the child and family, he or she is a mandatory \nreporter and has the responsibility to participate in the as\u00ad\nsessment of maltreatment, report suspected maltreatment \nto authorities (usually, an agency such as Child Protective \nServices and police), and protect the child from further harm. \nNovice nurses should tap into the experience and judgment \nof experienced nurses to help confirm any suspicions or con\u00ad\ncerns, as injury without maltreatment due to a fall or other \ntrauma is not uncommon, especially in small children as \nthey begin to walk (Flaherty et\u00a0al., 2014). Without immediate \nidentification, protection, and interventions, child maltreat\u00ad\nment can be perpetual, accelerating, and potentially fatal.\nPrinciples of childrearing and child care may be dictated \nby a family\u2019s cultural group and cultural norms. What is \naccepted in one cultural group may be considered a re\u00ad\nportable act of child abuse in another group. For example, \n\u201cfemale circumcision\u201d (i.e., female genital mutilation) is \nillegal in the United States and many other countries, but \nis considered culturally acceptable and even desirable in \nother parts of the world (CDC, 2016c; World Health Orga\u00ad\nnization, 2014). Despite the ban on this practice, the CDC \n(2016c) has reported its incidence to be on the rise in the \nUnited States due to immigration from regions where this \nFigure 13-1\u2002 Healthcare providers must be aware of the signs of \nabuse and know what to do to provide safety to the child.\n\u00a9 nautilus_shell_studios/iStock/Getty Images\n\t\nIntroduction\t\n165\n", "Figure 13-2\u2002 A parent\u2019s expectations that a young child will behave \nat a level above his or her developmental capacity may contribute to \nan abusive situation.\n\u00a9 SolStock/E+/Getty Images\ncontribute to an abusive situation. A parent\u2019s expectations \nthat a very young child will behave on a level above his or her \ndevelopmental capacity, or a parent\u2019s expectations that a young \nchild will do chores beyond his or her cognitive, emotional, or \nphysical development, may contribute to an abusive situation \nand are considered risk factors (Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, \n& Lozano, 2002) (Figure 13-2). Other child-associated risk \nfactors associated with maltreatment include the following:\n\u2022\t Children with a chronic health issue that imposes \ndemands exceeding the parent\u2019s ability to cope\n\u2022\t Children younger than three years of age\n\u2022\t Children with difficult or demanding temperaments\n\u2022\t Children who were unplanned or whose births \nwere unexpected\nIncidence and Prevalence of Child \nMaltreatment\nThe CDC (2016b) provides a breakdown of the various \nforms of child maltreatment into categories representing \nacts of commission (abuse\u2014that is, physical abuse, sexual \nabuse, and psychological abuse) and acts of omission \n(\u00adneglect\u2014that is, physical neglect, emotional neglect, medical/\ndental neglect, educational neglect, and failure to supervise). \nThe overall percentages for the incidences of these forms \nof abuse add up to more than 100%, as it is common for a \nchild to suffer multiple types of maltreatment (CDC, 2016a):\n\u2022\t Neglect: 52% of child maltreatment cases\n\u2022\t Physical abuse: 24%\n\u2022\t Sexual abuse: 12%\n\u2022\t Other (abandonment, school truancy, congenital \ndrug addiction, and more): 16%\nChild victims of abuse who have the highest incidence \nrates are infants across the first year of life (21% of cases). In \n2012, female children accounted for 51% and male children \naccounted for 49%. The reported three top ethnicities for \nchild abuse include Caucasian (44.0%), Hispanic (21.8%), \nand African-American (21%). Approximately 13% of \nreported pediatric abuse cases are concerning children \nwith disabilities (U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices, Administration for Children and Families, 2012).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nReducing Abuse Through Family Education\nPediatric nurses can contribute to the reduction of child \nmaltreatment by creating and implementing family educa\u00ad\ntion opportunities. Promoting educational opportunities for \nmiddle school and high school students to learn about \nfamily dynamics, self-care, safety in dating, therapeutic \ncommunication, acceptable discipline, stress reduction, and \nhealthy relationships can be highly beneficial in developing \nfoundations for good relationships and good parenting later \nin life. Local organizations that provide guidance in safe and \nappropriate care of children, teach appropriate child discipline, \nand offer safety nets for families to secure needed resources \nto reduce stress can also be of great assistance in reducing \nchild maltreatment rates. For example, providing courses in \n\u201cnever shaking your baby\u201d can save lives by reducing rates of \nshaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma.\nNurses should also be aware of, and teach families about, \nthe cycle of abuse\u2014a pattern of behavior in which children \nwho experience child maltreatment grow up and abuse \ntheir own children\u2014to help them understand how abuse \nsuffered in childhood affects adulthood:\n\u2022\t Thirty percent of abused children will grow up to \nabuse their own children (American Society for the \nPositive Care of Children, 2014).\n\u2022\t Eighty percent of children who were abused will meet \nthe criteria for at least one psychological/psychiatric \ndisorder. \nClearly, the impact of this disorder can last a lifetime.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nFacts for the Pediatric Nurse to Consider When \nAssessing a Possibly Abused Child\nAccording to the American Academy on Pediatrics\u2019 Committee \non Child Abuse and Neglect, the following evidence-based \ntips can be used to distinguish accidental traumatic injuries \nfrom abuse injuries (Flaherty et\u00a0al., 2014):\n\u2022\t Bruises and fractures are the most common injuries in \nchildren who have suffered physical abuse. Bruising \nin a child who is not yet mobile or bruises in unusual \nlocations (ears, neck, back of the legs, or trunk) should \nraise suspicion for abuse.\n(continues)\n166\t\nChapter 13\u2003 Caring for an Abused Child\n", "developmental period.

Injury \nthat causes lasting erythema is considered abuse \nin many states.\n\u25c6\u25c6Physical abuse can include repeated injuries to \nany of the child\u2019s systems, including the integu\u00ad\nmentary, reproductive, skeletal, peripheral ner\u00ad\nvous, or central nervous system.\n\u25c6\u25c6Unlawful corporal punishment is considered \nphysical abuse.\n\u2022\t Physical neglect\n\u25c6\u25c6Examples include not providing for a child\u2019s nu\u00ad\ntrition, warmth, clothing, housing, health care, \nsupervision, and education.\n\u25c6\u25c6Evidence of physical neglect in a child can in\u00ad\nclude very poor personal hygiene, poor academic \nperformance from deep hunger, and untreated \nmedical conditions.\n\u25c6\u25c6Dental neglect such as untreated caries or ab\u00ad\nscesses (significant pain) is a form of child abuse \nand is rarely the only form of neglect found in a \nchild with untreated dental issues (Bradbury-\nJones, Innes, Evans, Ballantyne, & Taylor, 2013).\n\u2022\t Emotional abuse\n\u25c6\u25c6Examples include belittling, ridiculing, degrad\u00ad\ning, or failing to provide a supportive environ\u00ad\nment in which the child can emotionally thrive.\n\u25c6\u25c6Other examples of emotional abuse include \nthreats, humiliation, blame, name-calling, and a \npersistent state of being ridiculed.\n\u2022\t Emotional neglect\n\u25c6\u25c6Examples include neglecting a child\u2019s emotions, \nnot attending to the child\u2019s psychological needs, \nor ignoring a child\u2019s emotional needs.\n\u2022\t Verbal abuse\n\u25c6\u25c6Examples include using aggressive, demanding, \ndetrimental, and demeaning forms of communi\u00ad\ncation as the primary method of engaging a child.\n\u2022\t Sexual abuse\n\u25c6\u25c6Examples include actual or threats of sexual \nabuse such as fondling, forced kissing, penetra\u00ad\ntion, oral copulation, anal intercourse, and vagi\u00ad\nnal intercourse.\n\u25c6\u25c6Sexual abuse may also include sexual exploita\u00ad\ntion of a child, pornographic photography of a \nchild, exposing a child to pornography, or genital \nexhibitionism in front of a child.\n\u25c6\u25c6Evidence of sexual abuse in children may include \nyeast infections, sexually transmitted infections, \nbruising to the genitalia, bleeding from the rec\u00ad\ntum or anus area, abdominal discomfort or pain, \nand acting out explicit sexual behaviors. Behaviors \nForms of Child Maltreatment\nChild maltreatment can present in one or more of six \ndistinct forms. It is not uncommon for a child to suffer \nmore than one form of maltreatment during a particular \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\u2002 (continued)\n\u2022\t Age of the child, location and type of injury, and \ndiscrepancies in history can help distinguish abuse.\n\u2022\t Eighty percent of abuse-related fractures occur in \nchildren younger than 18 months. In children younger \nthan 1 year who are not yet starting to walk, 25% of \nfractures are due to abuse. This includes long-bone \nfractures that are not generally considered suspicious \nin older (ambulatory) children.\n\u2022\t The most common fracture pattern found in abused chil\u00ad\ndren is a single long-bone diaphyseal fracture. The follow\u00ad\ning fractures have moderate to high specificity for abuse:\n\u25c6\u25c6High: rib fractures (presence is 95% predictive of \nabuse in children younger than 3 years)\n\u25c6\u25c6High: classic metaphyseal lesions (in first year of life)\n\u25c6\u25c6High: complex or bilateral skull fractures\n\u25c6\u25c6High: fractures of different ages or stages of healing*\n\u25c6\u25c6Moderate: epiphyseal separations\n\u25c6\u25c6Moderate: vertebral body fractures\n\u25c6\u25c6Moderate: digital fractures\n\u2022\t Long bone fractures (other than classic metaphyseal \nlesions), linear skull fractures, clavicle fractures, and \nisolated subperiosteal new bone formation are \nunlikely to indicate child abuse.\n\u2022\t Family history, evaluation of siblings, and lab values \nfor serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phospha\u00ad\ntase should be assessed to assist with supporting or \nruling out an abuse determination.\n\u25c6\u25c6Providers should ask themselves whether the injury \nis consistent with the described history of the injury \nor circumstances stated that caused the injury or \nevidence.\n\u25c6\u25c6Inconsistent, vague history, history that contradicts \nthe nature of the injury, or a significant (more than \n96 hours) delay in seeking care can offer clues to\u00ad\nward abuse.\n\u25c6\u25c6Approximately one-third of caregivers in abuse situ\u00ad\nations will give a false history of a high-impact acci\u00ad\ndent (e.g., car crash or fall from height). Others omit \nhistory or give inconsistent history.\n\u25c6\u25c6Most caregivers in non-abuse situations describe a \nlow-impact fall from stairs or rough play with a sibling. \n*Bone fragility due to prematurity, osteomyelitis, or syndromes such \nas osteogenesis imperfecta should be ruled out.\nData from Flaherty, E.

Basic abuse assessments should be performed on all \nchildren during health screenings, at wellness appointments, \nor when a family is seeking medical treatment for a health \nconcern or issue. The nurse should keep in mind that ap\u00ad\nproximately 25% of children (702,000 children in 2014 alone \nconfirmed by child protective agencies) are abused (CDC, \n2016a); thus, all children should be assessed for indicators \nof maltreatment such as the following:\n\u2022\t Burns (young children with immersion burns such \nas sock or glove burns, and older child with scalding \nburns from hot liquids being thrown) (Figure 13-3)\n\u2022\t Bite marks (double horseshoe, doughnut, or oval \nshaped) (Figure 13-4)\n\u2022\t Lacerations and abrasions (\u201cU\u201d or \u201cC\u201d shaped, such as a \nwhipping injury) (Figure 13-5)\n\u2022\t Bruises and contusions (especially on the face, but\u00ad\ntocks, back, or genitals, with a clear impression such \nas a handprint or a loop mark on a body curve)\n\u2022\t Evidence of neglect, such as failure to thrive, mal\u00ad\nnourishment, poor hygiene, and neglected medical \nconditions\n\u2022\t Evidence of emotional neglect, emotional abuse, and \nverbal abuse, including aversion to touch, withdrawal, \ninappropriate aggression (e.g., defiant or argumenta\u00ad\ntive behavior), hyperactivity, somatic symptoms such \nas stomachache or headache, or nonverbal behav\u00ad\niors such as twitching, pulling hair, rigidity/tensing, \nself-soothing movements such as rocking or stroking, \nor physical disengagement*\n* These behaviors may also indicate reluctance to disclose physical \nabuse to investigators (Katz et\u00a0al., 2012).\nData from Al Odhayani, A., Watson, W.

Similarly, specific disease states (osteogenesis \nimperfecta, osteomyelitis, and other forms of brittle bone \nor bruising disorders), markings (Mongolian spots), and \nother injuries (e.g., straddle injuries to the genitals in a \nchild who fell on a bicycle crossbar) can mimic maltreat\u00ad\nment even when none is present. In addition, some cultural \npractices might appear to be maltreatment when they are, \nin fact, considered healing practices to some cultures\u2014\nfor example, cupping, gua sha/coining, and moxibustion \n(Lilly\u00a0& Kundu, 2012) (Figure 13-6). Misdiagnosis of child \nmaltreatment can cause significant stress for a family and \nmisdirect resources that should be reserved for true cases \nof child maltreatment. The difficulty for the nurse, then, is \nidentifying those signals that point to abuse being present \nwhile ruling out other causes of injuries or psychiatric issues.\nBEST PRACTICES\nWays to Approach the Topic of Potential \nMaltreatment with Children in Various \nDevelopmental Stages\nThe pediatric nurse does not assess for child maltreatment \nalone; rather, the entire pediatric healthcare team will be in\u00ad\nvolved with the assessment and reporting of a suspected or \nactual case of abuse. The pediatric nurse, who is often trusted \nby the child and the family, is a good source of information \nin suspected maltreatment cases.\nInfants\nInfants are in Erikson\u2019s stage of \u201ctrust versus mistrust.\u201d Building \ncaring and trustful relationships in which infants\u2019 needs are \nmet and they feel safe is paramount. Infants have no way to \ncommunicate abuse, so the nurse must use objective data \nto discern if an infant is experiencing abuse. Growth charts \nmay reveal evidence of failure to thrive (repeated plots of \nanthropometrics below the 5th percentile). Physical exams \nshould include assessing for bruising, fractures, and marks \nmade by implements. \nToddlers\nToddlers are very emotional beings, who are in Erikson\u2019s stage \nof \u201cautonomy versus shame and doubt.\u201d Abused children in \nthis developmental stage may show delays in motor and \nlanguage development, and may act out aggressively toward \npeers with anger or violence.\nPreschoolers\nPreschool-age children are in Erikson\u2019s developmental stage of \n\u201cinitiative versus guilt.\u201d Children with suspected abuse should \nbe engaged through simple play situations such as dolls to \nallow them to reenact or demonstrate their emotions through \nthe use of medical play dolls. \nSchool-Age Children\nSchool-age children are in Erikson\u2019s stage of \u201cindustry ver\u00ad\nsus inferiority.\u201d Abused children in this stage may become \ndepressed, socially isolated, unfocused on schoolwork and \nacademic demands, distracted, overactive, and aggressive. A \ndeep sense of inferiority may also develop in abused school-\nage children.\nAdolescents\nTeens should be seeking and learning who they are, what \nthey want in life, and what their overall identity is. Accord\u00ad\ning to Erikson, adolescents are in the developmental stage \nof \u201cidentity versus role confusion.\u201d Abused and neglected \nteens may become truants; may demonstrate depres\u00ad\nsion, withdrawal, and disengagement; or may engage in \nhigh-risk behaviors that can lead to unlawful behavior and \ndelinquency.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nBecoming a Sexual Abuse Forensic Nurse\nForensic nursing\u2014a relatively new specialty area recognized \nby the American Nurses Association (ANA)\u2014is defined as the \n\u201capplication of nursing science to public or legal proceedings.\u201d \nNurses who become forensic specialists provide assistance in \ncollecting evidence and identifying perpetrators of violent crimes. \nForensic nurses may be requested to provide legal opinions and \ntestify in court. The goal of this specialty is to develop healthcare \nexpertise that provides skills to assist in establishing legal causation \nand responsibility for violent and traumatic injuries. Education \nrequired to become a forensic nurse can be found in four areas: \n(1) continuing education courses; (2) certification programs of\u00ad\nfered by universities; (3) elective courses offered within graduate \nor undergraduate programs; and (4) graduate studies programs \nwith a core forensic nursing curriculum. See the website of the \nInternational Association of Forensic Nurses (IAFN; www.iafn.org) or \nAmerican Forensic Nurses (www.amrn.com) for more information.\nAs with any patient, the first step in the patient assess\u00ad\nment is to identify the nature and severity of the injury. It \nis crucial that the patient\u2019s physical well-being be managed \nbefore any steps are taken to determine whether child \nmaltreatment has occurred. In life-threatening situations \nsuch as a skull fracture, internal bleeding or compromised \nairway/circulation, stabilizing the patient takes precedence \nover gathering information for reporting, even when the \nhistory offers clear evidence of maltreatment. In taking the \n\t\nAssessing for Child Maltreatment\t\n169\n", "situations, the caregiver\u2019s own expressions of concern, worry, \nfear, or similar emotions will likely support the proposition \nthat he or she is truly ignorant of the nature of the incident.\nIn assessing injuries, the nurse should bear in mind which \nkinds of forces and activities would appropriately produce \nthe injury. For example, bruising in school-age or ambulatory \npreschool/toddler-age children is normal, but such bruises \nwill generally occur on extensor surfaces\u2014that is, surfaces \nof muscles that move a body part, such as elbows, knees, \nshins, and forehead. Bruises should be considered suspicious \nfor child maltreatment if they occur in locations other than \nwhere a child might land after falling, such as the back, upper \narms, upper legs, abdomen, buttocks, or ear (Blair, Clauss, & \nMeredith, 2011), particularly if the explanation for the injury \nis inconsistent with its presentation (e.g., a caregiver claims \nthe child fell down a flight of stairs but bruises appear only \non the child\u2019s torso and not on the legs, knees, or arms). \nIn children age 4 and younger, findings predictive of mal\u00ad\ntreatment include bruising on the torso, ear, or neck for a \nchild and bruising in any region for an infant younger than \n4 months (Pierce, Kaczor, Aldrige, O\u2019Flynn, & Lorenz, 2010).\nIn many cases, however, the nature of the injury or com\u00ad\nplaint may mask the presence of maltreatment. The following \nsigns should raise suspicion and prompt nurses to examine \nor question the patient or caregiver more thoroughly:\n\u2022\t Vague, inconsistent, or absent explanation of how \nan injury occurred\n\u2022\t Significant (more than 96 hours) delay in seeking \ncare for a significant illness or injury\n\u2022\t Distracted, irritable, or uninterested affect in the \ncaregiver\n\u2022\t Unexplained injuries to the genitals or presence of \nsexually transmitted disease symptoms in a child or \nsexually immature adolescent\n\u2022\t Underweight or subnormal height, evidence of \nmalnutrition, significantly unkempt appearance \n(dirty, ill-fitting clothes and matted hair), or verbal \nexpression of extreme hunger\n\u2022\t Seizure in an afebrile child with no history of seizure\nIn contrast, other aspects of the child\u2019s presentation and \nhistory may allay suspicions of maltreatment:\n\u2022\t Documented history of a disorder leading to fre\u00ad\nquent bruising, brittle bones, or other symptoms \nthat might otherwise be concerning\n\u2022\t Appropriate display of affection, concern, and en\u00ad\ngagement by the caregiver, reciprocated (when pos\u00ad\nsible) by the child\n\u2022\t History of ailment or injury that is consistent with \nthe presentation\n\u2022\t Appropriateness of the complaint to the patient\u2019s \nage and developmental stage (e.g., multiple bruises \nFAMILY EDUCATION\nNever, Ever Shake an Infant!\nSerious head trauma occurs when an infant is shaken. Shaken \nbaby syndrome (also called abusive head trauma) is defined \nas a constellation of signs and symptoms that result when \nan infant or young child is violently shaken with coup/\ncontrecoup forces. The violent shaking can lead to seizures, \nstupor, coma, and death. The traumatized brain tissue is in\u00ad\njured through damage to and destruction of blood vessels, \nincreased intracranial pressure, brain tissue hypoxia, and retinal \nhemorrhages. Outcomes for infants subjected to shaken baby \nsyndrome range from mild learning and behavioral issues to \npersistent vegetative state to death.\nParents must be repeatedly educated on the importance \nof never shaking their infant. \nFigure 13-6\u2002 Some cultural practices, such as cupping, might ap\u00ad\npear to be maltreatment when they are, in fact, considered healing \npractices to some cultures.\nPeter Banos/Alamy Stock Photo\nhistory from the child\u2019s caregiver, the American Academy of \nPediatrics notes that \u201cthe best approach is to allow the parent \nor other caregiver to provide a narrative without interrup\u00ad\ntions, so that the history is not influenced by the clinician\u2019s \nquestions or interpretations\u201d (Christian, 2015). Doing so \nallows the nurse to assess the caregiver\u2019s behavior as well.\nWith a stable patient, it is important to obtain a history of \nhow the injury occurred or, in the event of a psychiatric or \nmental health crisis, what may have preceded the change in the \nchild\u2019s behavior. Be aware that caregivers may not necessarily \nknow the specifics of some incidents; for example, a child \nwho has been sexually assaulted outside the home may be \ntoo fearful, shamed, or confused to explain to the parent what \nhappened (particularly if the assailant is someone known to \nthem, such as a family member or the other parent). In such \n170\t\nChapter 13\u2003 Caring for an Abused Child\n", "on a 4-month-old\u2019s extensor surfaces would be con\u00ad\nsidered suspicious, but the same bruises would be \nconsidered normal in a 14-month-old)\nIf a healthcare practitioner develops reasonable suspi\u00ad\ncion of child maltreatment, he or she is mandated to report \nit. Most laws indicate that when a healthcare professional, \nor other mandatory reporter, suspects abuse either by vi\u00ad\nsual evidence or \u201cgut feelings,\u201d \u201cbells going off,\u201d or \u201cbeing \nuncomfortable\u201d with the child\u2019s emotional and physical \npresentation, reporting should take place. It is in the best \ninterest of all concerned to ensure that physical examina\u00ad\ntion, history taking, and documentation are thorough and \ncomplete if maltreatment is suspected (Blair et\u00a0al., 2011).\nBEST PRACTICES\nTalking to a Family About Suspected Child Abuse\nSuspected child abuse is an emotionally difficult issue for the \npediatric healthcare team. Having a \u201ctime-out\u201d or a huddle \nabout the case can provide support and confidence for \nthe provider when the team agrees a suspicion of abuse is \nwarranted. The following are a few opening lines a nurse can \nuse with the family to introduce this topic:\n\u2022\t \u201cI have concerns that someone may have hurt your child.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cI am required by law to report what I am worried \nabout in your child.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cLet\u2019s talk for a moment away from your child so I can \nexpress a concern I am seeing.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cIt is our priority to provide safety for you and your \nchild. We have a concern that your child has not been \nprovided safety.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nUnusual Cases of Child Abuse: \nMunchausen\u00a0Syndrome by Proxy\nMunchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP)\u2014sometimes \ncalled medical child abuse\u2014is a rare, sometimes fatal \nform of child maltreatment in which a caregiver (often the \nmother, and sometimes with healthcare education or ex\u00ad\nperience) fabricates, exaggerates, or induces the symptoms \nof a medical condition in a child as a way of getting atten\u00ad\ntion. The caregiver may describe symptoms that cannot be \nobserved clinically and that occur only when the child is \nalone with the abuser. Often the child appears well despite \nthe caregiver\u2019s insistence that he or she is ill. Alternatively, \nthe perpetrator may cause the child harm\u2014for example, \nsuffocating or choking a young child or force-feeding \nthe child with a harmful substance\u2014and seek assistance \nclaiming the ailment was mysterious or accidental.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nR\neporting of child abuse cases, either suspected or confirmed, \nthat are considered high priority are stipulated to occur \nwithin 24 hours of encountering the abused child. Early and \nrapid reporting saves lives and reduces further harm (U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Administration \nfor Children and Families, 2014).\nLegal Aspects of Care for an \nAbused\u00a0Child\nThe legal aspects of caring for children who have been \nsuspected or found to have been experiencing abuse vary in \ndifferent states. It is imperative that all pediatric healthcare \nprofessionals learn the relevant laws of the state in which \nthey practice. State laws will outline when a report must \ntake place, with most requiring reporting within 24 hours \nof the determination of suspected child abuse at the lat\u00ad\nest. Reports can be started verbally but must be followed \nup within the 24-hour period with a written report. The \nprivacy protections of the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act (HIPAA) do not apply to child \nabuse and neglect reporting, so the nurse must provide \ncomprehensive information about the child\u2019s condition, \ncontact information, and pertinent medical records. \nSome states require that the reporter contact both the law \nenforcement agency and Child Protective Services (CPS).\nAs a result of the unnecessary, sometimes painful, and \npotentially harmful medical care that they experience, the \nchildren of these abusers are subjected to both physical and \nemotional trauma. MSBP cases result in increased hospitaliza\u00ad\ntions, leading to significant child morbidity and, in some cases, \nmortality. Nursing staff should be aware of this syndrome in cases \nwhere a child has a history of multiple, repeated complaints of \nunknown etiology. One clear warning sign is that the abuser \ndoes not demonstrate a normal level of concern about the \nchild\u2019s hospitalization and subsequent diagnostic exams and \nprocedures, yet seeks to stay in contact with the child at all times \nand refuses to leave the child alone (Lasher & Sheridan, 2013).\nData from Boyd, Ritchie, & Likhari, 2014; Depauw, Loas, & Delhaye, \n2015; Gehlawat, Gehlawat, Singh, & Gupta, 2015; Grace & Jagannathan, \n2015; Lasher & Sheridan, 2013; Roesler, 2015.\nThe reporter of child abuse must be available for further \ninquiry or clarification of information. Most institutions have \ndeveloped a plan and mechanism through which to make a \nreport. The institutional social worker, nursing administra\u00ad\ntor, and emergency room team can all be of assistance to \n\t\nLegal Aspects of Care for an Abused\u00a0Child\t\n171\n", "BEST PRACTICES\nT\nhe healthcare team should work together to provide the \nabused child with the following support:\n\u2022\t Stabilization. The child\u2019s physical and emotional state \nneeds to be stabilized. Immediate care should be pro\u00ad\nvided to diagnose and treat any conditions associated \nwith the abuse. The team must provide early iden\u00ad\ntification and treatment of physical harm (e.g., head \ntrauma, neurologic stabilization, setting fractures, and \nstopping bleeding) as a first priority.\n\u2022\t Protection from harm. Preventing further harm to the \nchild may require a police hold and hospital or institu\u00ad\ntional security involvement. Temporary medical foster \ncare may be required and will be set up through the \nassistance of the social worker and CPS advocate.\n\u2022\t History taking. Inconsistencies between the signs and \nsymptoms of the injury and the parental/child history \nor description of abuse must be determined.\n\u2022\t Data collection and documentation. Specimens, such \nas semen, blood, urine, and human hairs from the \nchild\u2019s body, may need to be taken, and X-rays and \nother diagnostics may need to be performed. Photo\u00ad\ngraphs may be required, in which case strict policies \nmust be followed\u2014including use of only approved \nequipment, not personal cell phone cameras.\nhow to use teamwork to confirm suspicions of child abuse. \nThe benefits of this structure include having access to ex\u00ad\nperienced pediatric providers, social workers, and nursing \nadministrators, and, often, having established relationships \nwith local authorities and Child Protective Services. The \npediatric nurse who suspects child abuse within a hospital \nsetting never has to work independently on the case.\nSchools\nSchool nurses will be informed about their school district\u2019s \nchild abuse screening and reporting policies. Child abuse that \nis suspected by a classroom teacher, administrative assistant, \nor school administrator might be communicated to the \nschool nurse to seek the nurse\u2019s involvement and assistance \nwith follow-through. Because the child is not in a healthcare \narena, the school nurse needs to use skills in interviewing \nthe child, working with the teachers to craft a report to CPS \nand being supportive of the child to reduce fears and anxiety.\nClinics\nAmbulatory care settings that provide health care to chil\u00ad\ndren should have policies and practices for how evidence is \ncollected, how interviews take place with family members, \nand how personnel fill out a child abuse report. Having a \nfile readily available with contact information for local CPS \nand law enforcement agencies would be helpful. Running \npractice scenarios can help the team be more confident \nand ready when a case occurs.\nhelp with the report and make sure local and state laws are \nfollowed. The consequences of not reporting can be severe, \nranging from loss of license to practice to hefty fines and/\nor jail time. Both a mandatory reporter and a volunteer \nreporter of child abuse will be immune from liability if the \nreport is made in good faith\u2014that is, out of genuine belief \nthat maltreatment is present, rather than for some other \nrationale\u2014and with reasonable suspicion. Nevertheless, \nbecause of the potential for a child maltreatment case to end \nin a court case or trial (often many years after the incident \nthat led to reporting), thorough documentation is essential.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nH\nealth care professionals make approximately three-\nfifths (58%) of all child neglect and abuse reports annually. It \nis imperative that the pediatric nurse is educated, prepared, and \nconfident in making a report so that children who are abused can \nbe identified early and quickly (U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Administration for Children and Families, 2014).\nBEST PRACTICES\nDealing with Doubts About Abuse\nIf a pediatric nurse is not sure that what is being seen or \nheard is considered abuse, it is better to seek the help of \nexperienced professionals than to not report. Good-faith \nsuspicion or reasonable belief is enough to warrant reporting \nchild abuse. Most states require that a report be made when \nthe reporter \u201cin his or her official capacity, suspects or has \nreason to believe that a child has been abused or neglected.\u201d\nData from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Children\u2019s \nBureau.

The child may be brought in by the abuser \nor a caregiver willingly; once the parent or caregiver realizes \nhe or she is under suspicion for maltreatment, however, \nthat person may leave the healthcare facility with the child. \nThis behavior, which is called leaving against medical advice \n(AMA), can place the child in great jeopardy. The police, \nsheriff, or other law enforcement representative must \nbe contacted immediately in such a case.\nHospitals\nAcute care hospitals that provide care to children within \nemergency departments, inpatient units, or pediatric criti\u00ad\ncal care units will have policies and procedures that specify \n172\t\nChapter 13\u2003 Caring for an Abused Child\n", "Preventing Child Maltreatment\nBecause of the serious nature of child abuse, and its po\u00ad\ntentially long-lasting consequences for the victim of abuse \nthroughout childhood and spanning into adulthood, the \ngoal for care in regard to child maltreatment centers on \nprevention. Neglect, which is the most common form of \nchild maltreatment, is often difficult to identify in its early \nstages, as stressors related to unemployment and economic \ncrises may have contributed to families not being able to \nprovide for the needs of their child. Purposive neglect, \nas a form of punishment, must be identified early before \nserious consequences occur for the child. Prevention is the \nkey to avoiding the long-term effects of abuse and neglect, \nbut it is also complex. Preventing fatal consequences of \nchild abuse is paramount. Fatalities associated with child \nabuse are associated with significant head and abdominal \ninjuries (Bensel, Rheinberger, & Radbill, 1997).\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nA\nbused female children have a 25% greater chance of \nexperiencing an adolescent pregnancy. Pediatric nurses \nshould speak frankly about this issue to teens who have been \nor are being abused. Information about preventing preg\u00ad\nnancy should be shared, and information on local resources \nshould be provided (American Society for the Positive Care \nof Children, 2014).\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nCommon Signs of Neglect \n\u2022\t Failure to thrive\n\u2022\t Clothing that is dirty, ragged, ill fitting, or inappro\u00ad\npriate for weather conditions, particularly in a child \nwhose family is not experiencing economic hardship\nCase Study\nA Caucasian male infant with Down syndrome, age 11 \nmonths, was admitted to the pediatric unit of a large urban \nhospital for weight loss, inconsolable crying, and fever that \nhis parents say has been occurring for 2 days.

Early \nidentification programs such as Child\u2013Parent Centers are \nfunded especially to provide education for parents and \nguardians. One study by Reynolds and Roberston (2003) \nfound that young children whose families participated in \nthis type of program (Title 1 Child\u2013Parent Center) had a \n52% reduction in child maltreatment rates. Knowing when \nto respond to a child\u2019s physical and emotional needs, provid\u00ad\ning appropriate discipline, and good communication skills \nare all part of positive parenting strategies (CDC, 2016a). \nNotably, programs that set out to improve parent\u2012child \nrelationships, and those that provide social support and \nrole modeling, have successfully reduced the incidence of \nchild abuse (Poole, Seal, & Taylor, 2014).\nEarly reporting is the very essence of prevention of \nfurther harm. If a pediatric healthcare team member \nsuspects a child is being maltreated or is under threat of \nbeing maltreated, that professional should call the National \nChild Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child (1-800-422-4453).\n\t\nPreventing Child Maltreatment\t\n173\n", "report suspected or actual child abuse can be subject to \nheavy fines, suspension or loss of license, and/or jail time.\n\u25c6\u25c6There are six types of child maltreatment: physical abuse, \nphysical neglect, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, \nverbal abuse, and sexual abuse. It is not uncommon for \nan abused child to be experiencing more than one type \nof maltreatment.\n\u25c6\u25c6Consequences of child maltreatment can be found in \neach of the developmental stages.

This system comprises the organs \nof digestion along with several accessory organs\u2014the \nliver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Disorders of the GI sys-\ntem relate specifically to a disruption of the absorption or \nelimination function. Disorders are generally categorized \nas either primary (congenital or acquired) or secondary. \nFurthermore, disorders of the GI system are organized \ninto three major and distinct areas: obstructive disorders, \ninfectious/inflammatory disorders, and structural disorders. \nMany GI disorders disrupt children\u2019s nutritional intake \nand put them at risk for malnutrition, delayed growth and \ndevelopment, and failure to thrive. A pediatric healthcare \nteam approach is needed to assist families through the \nearly identification, diagnostic exams, and treatments for \ndisorders of the gastrointestinal system, as many of these \ndisorders require lengthy treatment regimens and some \nare lifelong diagnoses.\nThe development of the GI system begins in the fourth \nfetal week of gestation. As part of this development, the \nintestinal lining forms multiple layers, including the \nepithelium, mucosa with goblet mucus-producing cells, \nsubmucosa, circular muscular layer, longitudinal mus-\ncular layer, and serosa (intraperitoneal) and adventitia \n(retroperitoneal) (Figure 14-1). An intact mucosa layer \nis critical to lubricate the intestines and prevent first the \ninfant and then the child from damage caused by normal \ndigestive enzymes.\nOne critical aspect of the development of the newborn\u2019s \nhost defenses is the colonization of the intestinal tract with \nbacteria (especially Bacteroides) that produce vitamin K. \nOwing to their immature host defenses, newborns have a \nhigher (though rare) risk of bleeding due to their innately \nlow levels of vitamin K, which is required for coagulation \nprocesses. This bleeding disorder\u2014which is vitamin K \ndeficiency bleeding (VKDB)\u2014is most concerning if the \nnewborn experiences bleeding into the brain or intestines. \nOnly very small quantities of vitamin K are required for \nadequate blood coagulation, however, and development \nof a vitamin K deficiency is unlikely once bacteria have \ncolonized the infant\u2019s intestine and during the remainder \nof the life span. Only severe dietary deficiencies, such as \nthose associated with cystic fibrosis, are apt to trigger the \nneed for vitamin K administration. Neonates remain at the \ngreatest risk for this condition due to their endogenous \n(low intestinal colonization) and exogenous (poor placental \nprovisions) deficiencies (Lippi & Franchini, 2011).\nGastrointestinal System Function \nAcross Childhood\nThe GI tract, also called the alimentary canal, is a lengthy \ntube beginning at the mouth and ending at the anus. This \ntract is responsible for the functions of swallowing, di-\ngesting, secreting digestive enzymes, absorbing a variety \nof nutrients, absorbing and secreting body fluids, and \nelimination. Each developmental stage has challenges and \nexpectations for mastery related to growth and develop-\nment of the GI system.\n\u2022\t Newborns (birth to 28 days): The newborn must \nmaster how to suck reflexively, swallow, digest, \nand absorb and eliminate nutrition and fluids. \nNewborns do not have saliva, nor do they initially \nproduce adequate digestive enzymes (i.e., amylase, \nlipase, and trypsin) until they reach 4 months of \nage. Infants do not swallow voluntarily until they \nare 6 weeks old. The lower GI tract is relatively \nshorter in the newborn and early infancy period; \ndue to the decreased intestinal surface area avail-\nable to reabsorb water, newborns have more watery \nand looser stools compared to older children.\n\u2022\t Infants (1 month to 1 year): Through \u00adcoordinated \nand voluntary swallowing, the infant must learn \nto pace feeding and not choke. The infant learns \nto eat new foods, progressing from a breast milk \nor \u00adformula-exclusive diet to the addition of \niron-fortified cereals (maternal-derived iron stores \nare depleted by 6 months of age), to the addition of \nfirst vegetables, then fruits, then proteins.\n\u2022\t Toddlers: The young toddler has the challenge of \nbecoming ready for and then mastering bowel \n\u00adcontrol (toilet training) by controlling his or her \nelimination at will. Each child has his or her own \nFigure 14-1\u2002 The layers of GI mucosa. \nSmall\nintestine\nLarge\nintestine\nSerosa\nSubmucosa\nMucosa\nEpithelial\ncells\nMucus\nLumen\nMuscle\nlayers\n178\t\nChapter 14\u2003 Gastrointestinal Elimination\n", "The weight of the dry diaper is subtracted from the weight \nof the soiled diaper for accurate measurement of output.\nTo assess the GI tract, the pediatric healthcare team can \nuse a variety of tools and diagnostics, including barium \nenemas to visualize the entire large intestine, upper GI \nradiography, small bowel follow-through to view the \u00adupper \nintestines, cholangiography to examine the gallbladder, \nand liver biopsy to investigate disease and neoplasm. \nAdditional assessments include serum chemistry, liver \nand lipid profiles, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), \nC-reactive protein (CRP), stool examination for ova and \nparasites, presence of elevated white blood cell (WBC) \ncount, reducing substances, and stool culture for specific \npathogens. Fecal fat may be collected to rule out fat \nmetabolism disorders.\nPain in the Gastrointestinal System\nAbdominal pain is considered the number one complaint \nacross childhood. Most abdominal pain has no known \netiology and resolves without intervention. Nevertheless, \nabdominal pain during childhood is real and needs to \nbe evaluated. Stress during childhood, including school \ndifficulties, peer pressure, social interactions, and family \ndynamics, can lead a child to complain of stomachaches.\nTo evaluate a child\u2019s pain, the nurse should obtain \na thorough health history and description of the chief \ncomplaint, including its timing, influencing factors, trig-\ngers, and severity. Pediatric pain tools should be used to \nascertain the location and severity of the pain. Subjective \npain tools such as the FACES tool, objective pain tools \nsuch as the Objective Pain Score (Tandon et\u00a0al., 2016), \nand physiological measurements of vital signs should all \nbe used to assess a child\u2019s complaint of abdominal pain.\ntime frame for toilet training, but most children \nmaster bowel control by age 3 years. The age range \nis wide, however\u2014from 1 to 5 years. Mastery of \nbowel control is typically required before a young \nchild attends preschool. Toddlers have slowed \ngrowth patterns and require fewer calories than \nthey did during infancy. They may appear finicky \nand experience food \u201cjags\u201d or \u201clags.\u201d\n\u2022\t Preschoolers: By the end of the preschool period, the \nchild\u2019s intestinal tract is mature and produces adult-\nlike stools. This is also a time of slower growth and \ndevelopment, along with fewer calorie needs.\n\u2022\t School age and older: It is not until the 6th year \nof life that a child has adequate amounts and full \nstrength of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The \nGI tract is fully mature and the child may pass one \nstool a day that is fully formed.\nAssessment of the Gastrointestinal System\nThe assessment of the pediatric GI system begins with a \npertinent family health history, then progresses to ques-\ntions related to GI illnesses, surgeries, injuries, or accidents. \nPhysical assessment includes height; weight; abdominal \ncircumference (measure at the end of a respiratory ex-\npiration, with a tape placed horizontally at the tip of the \niliac crest, snug but not tight); hydration status, including \nmucous membrane moisture, turgor, and presence of tears; \nand quality of the child\u2019s peripheral pulses.\nThe sequence of physical assessment in this system is \nimportant. Notably, if the child is experiencing acute pain, \npalpation should be performed last. The nurse should begin \nwith a visual assessment of the child\u2019s abdomen, noting \nwhether it is concave or convex. Next, the nurse should \nmeasure the circumference of the abdomen, followed by \nauscultation, percussion, and finally light to deep palpa-\ntion. At the bedside, the pediatric nurse should weigh all \ndiapers produced by newborns and toddlers (Figure 14-2). \n QUALITY AND SAFETY\nI\nf an acute condition is suspected, such as appendicitis, active \nbleeding, or intestinal rupture, the pediatric nurse should not \nperform palpation due to the possibility of inflicting further \ntrauma. For instance, if a child presents with a suspected \nruptured appendix, a sign can be hung on the child\u2019s crib \nor bed stating \u201cDo Not Palpate Child\u2019s Abdomen\u201d until final \nconfirmation has been established.\nFigure 14-2\u2002 The pediatric nurse should weigh all diapers produced \nby newborns and toddlers. \nNursing Care of a Child with a \nGastrointestinal System Disorder\nMany GI system disorders affecting nutrition and elimination \nrequire lengthy and complex management. Some disorders \nrequire several surgeries to establish normal or near-normal \nfunction. Congenital disorders such as anorectal malformations \n\t\nNursing Care of a Child with a Gastrointestinal System Disorder\t\n179\n", "\u2022\t Hypertonic:\n\u25c6\u25c6The child\u2019s body water loss is greater than the \nelectrolyte loss; serum sodium is more than 150 \nmEq/L.\n\u25c6\u25c6The majority of fluid shifts are intracellular to \nextracellular.\ncan require early surgical interventions and pose risks for \ncomplications. Some GI disorders cause complications in \nthe genitourinary system (rectal\u2012vaginal fistulas) and the \nrespiratory system (tracheal\u2012esophageal atresia). A child with \na serious biliary atresia may suffer failure to thrive and develop \nsevere complications including need for liver transplantation.\nOlder children with GI system disorders may be very \nemotionally vulnerable owing to the presence of a condition \naffecting the elimination tract. A disorder that causes acute \ndiarrhea or constipation, or requires a structural diversion \nsuch as an ostomy, may lead the child to experience low \nself-esteem and poor body image. It is imperative that the \npediatric nurse demonstrate no evidence of judgment or \nnegativity and be supportive and caring.\nDehydration\nMany disorders related to elimination cause a child to be-\ncome dehydrated, a condition in which fluid loss exceeds \nfluid intake. Dehydration can be assessed by determining a \nchild\u2019s loss of weight compared to weight prior to the illness:\n\u2022\t Mild dehydration is defined as a weight of 5% or less \nin infants and a 3% to 4% weight loss in children.\n\u2022\t Moderate dehydration is defined as 10% weight loss \nin infants and 6% to 8% weight loss in children.\n\u2022\t Severe dehydration is defined as 15% weight loss in \ninfants and 10% weight loss in children.\nSeveral measurement tools are available for assessing \ndehydration\u2014the World Health Organization (WHO) \nscale, the Gorelick scale, and the Clinical Dehydration \nScale (CDS), to name a few (Pringle et\u00a0al., 2011). Efforts \nto validate them have produced mixed results. In general, \nhowever, four factors are most likely to predict dehydra-\ntion well: delayed capillary refill time (more than 2 seconds \nsuggests dehydration), skin turgor, abnormal respiratory \npattern, and a generally ill appearance characterized by lack \nof moisture in the mucous membranes. Presence of at least \ntwo of these signs suggests a fluid deficit of 5% or greater, \nparticularly if they are observed in combination of care-\ngiver reports of lower-than-normal tear production or the \npresence of vomiting or diarrhea (Canavan & Arant, 2009).\nIn general, three types of dehydration are distinguished:\n\u2022\t Isotonic:\n\u25c6\u25c6Equal loss of water and sodium occurs; serum \nsodium is normal (130\u2013150 mEq/L).\n\u25c6\u25c6The majority of the fluid lost is extracellular.\n\u25c6\u25c6Hypovolemic shock can occur.\n\u2022\t Hypotonic:\n\u25c6\u25c6The child\u2019s electrolyte loss exceeds the water loss; \nserum sodium is less than 130 mEq/L.\n\u25c6\u25c6The majority of fluid shifts are extracellular to \nintracellular.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nO\nral rehydration, as described later in the \u201cAcute Diarrhea\u201d \nsection, is the first choice in most situations. If oral \nrehydration is not an option, however, rehydrate children \nwith isotonic and hypotonic dehydration relatively rapidly \nwith fluid boluses of 0.9% normal saline (NS) and ongoing \nintravenous fluids (IVF). Do not use this technique to rapidly \nreplace fluids in case of hypertonic dehydration, as it can lead \nto severe and even fatal cerebral edema.\nStructural Disorders\nStructural disorders include those that affect the physical \nstructures of the GI system. Disorders that interfere with \nprofusion, absorption, and elimination can be found any-\nwhere along the alimentary tract. Examples of structural \ndisorders are presented in Table 14-1.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nT\nhe pediatric healthcare team and the parents can use \nthe ESSR method for feeding an infant with a cleft palate: \nEnlarged nipple, Stimulate suck by gently rubbing the nipple \non the infant\u2019s lower lip, Swallow, Rest.\nObstructive Disorders\nPediatric GI obstructive disorders prevent a child from \nhaving normal and expected patterns of elimination. Some \nof these disorders are so severe that no food passes from \nthe stomach to the small intestine and no stool passes \nthrough the intestines. Several common obstructive orders \nare profiled in Table 14-2.\nInflammatory Disorders\nDisorders that produce a level of inflammation that causes \ntissue damage can affect a child at any point \u00adduring the \ndevelopmental period. Inflammatory disorders can \ncause significant pain and are associated with serious \n\u00adcomplications, including infection and sepsis. Examples \nof common inflammatory disorders in children can be \nfound in Table 14-3.\n180\t\nChapter 14\u2003 Gastrointestinal Elimination\n", "TABLE 14-1\u2003\nStructural Disorders\nHernia\nDiagnosis: A diaphragmatic hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents (intestines) through an opening in the diaphragm \nmuscle. Its etiology is a congenital disorder of the transverse septum and inability of the pleuroperitoneal folds to fully develop \nin utero. In general, the intestines and abdominal structures enter the thoracic cavity. Other hernias, such umbilical and inguinal, \nare caused by weakened abdominal musculature that leads to tissue and intestinal protrusion (Figure 14-3). \nRisk Factors: There are no known risk factors for the development of hernias. With diaphragmatic hernias, the fetus is at risk for \nimpaired lung growth, and the newborn is at risk for respiratory compromise.\nTreatment: Surgery is required for repair of most hernias, although some small umbilical hernias resolve spontaneously. The \ntype of nursing care needed depends on the type of hernia and its extent as well as the impacts on other affected organs (e.g., \nthe lungs and heart in diaphragmatic hernia, the intestines in inguinal hernia). Most hernias are addressed as soon as possible to \navoid complications, so family education related to risks and benefits of surgery will be needed (Hatfield, 2014).\nAnorectal Malformations: Imperforate Anus\nDiagnosis: Anorectal malformations include congenital absence of a patent anorectal canal, a severe narrowing of the anal \ncanal, or the presence of only a fistula (external to the peritoneum). An immediate assessment of patency is performed when a \nmalformation has been identified during the immediate post-birth time frame or if the newborn fails to pass meconium stool. \nRisk Factors: Because this condition is associated with many congenital syndromes, a geneticist may be contacted to rule out \nother conditions.\nTreatment: Treatment consists of surgical repair. In some infants, the blockage is a thin membrane that can be repaired \nimmediately. If the defect is more significant, the child may have a colostomy performed as an initial measure, with a more \nextensive surgical repair being planned when the child reaches 3 to 5 months of age. In such cases, the family will need \neducation on colostomy care (Hatfield, 2014). \nFigure 14-3\u2002 A diaphragmatic hernia. \n(continues)\n\t\nInflammatory Disorders\t\n181\n", "Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER)\nDiagnosis: Regurgitation (reflux) of gastric contents into the esophagus due to the incompetence or relaxation of the lower \nesophageal sphincter causes the child to experience pain. When the condition progresses to esophageal tissue damage \n(esophagitis) due to the low pH of the gastric acid, the condition is called gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD). Other possible \nGERD symptoms include nausea, chest pain, tooth erosion, halitosis, and respiratory complications from stomach acid entering \ninto the lungs (pneumonia, laryngitis, asthma, hoarseness) (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2015).\nRisk Factors: Risk factors for the development of GER include prematurity and delayed maturation of the lower esophageal \nneuromuscular function.\nTreatment: Most GER will resolve on its own. If tissue damage occurs and GERD is developing, the child will need surgical \ninterventions (Nissen fundoplication, in which the gastric fundus is wrapped around the distal esophagus structure to remove \nthe damaged tissue; Figure 14-4). Postsurgical nursing care includes maintaining the integrity of suture lines and preventing \nand managing pain, nausea, and vomiting. Caregivers should receive education in the 2 weeks following surgery regarding \nhome care so as to avoid complications (Hazan, Gamarra, Stawick, & Maas, 2009).\nThe infant with GER or GERD may benefit from smaller, more frequent feedings and positioning prone with the head elevated \nafter feeds.\nMedications given for GI reflux include the following agents:\n\u203a\u203a\nHistamine blockers such as ranitidine and famotidine\n\u203a\u203a\nProton-pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole and omeprazole\n\u203a\u203a\nProkinetic agents to rapidly empty the stomach\nCleft Lip/Cleft Palate\nDiagnosis: Cleft lip and cleft palate are two distinctly different disorders that arise during fetal development at different times. \nCleft lip arises in the 7th week of gestation when facial tissue fails to join completely; it can involve a small notch in the upper \nlip or can extend to complete separation from the lip to the nose (Figure 14-5). Cleft palate arises in the 9th week of gestation; \nit consists of cleft in the soft palate, in the hard palate, or extending through both (Figure 14-6). Diagnosis of these two \nconditions is made via visual inspection of the neonate.\nRisk Factors: The prevalence of cleft lip is approximately 1 per 1000 live births. It is much more common in boys than in girls, \nand is correlated with hereditary, teratogenic, and environmental factors. Cleft palate is less common, occurring in 1 in every \n2500 live births. \nFigure 14-4\u2002 Nissen fundoplication. \nNormal stomach\nNissen fundoplication\nTABLE 14-1\u2003\nStructural Disorders (continued)\n182\t\nChapter 14\u2003 Gastrointestinal Elimination\n", "Treatment: Surgery is required for both cleft lip and cleft palate. Nursing care focuses on assessing for problems with \nfeeding and the development of respiratory complications, as aspiration and choking are common in children with these \ndisorders. Postoperative care includes carefully maintaining the integrity of the suture lines, which will include a Logan bow \n(Figure 14-7). The use of elbow restraints is often recommended, although there is no evidence of their benefit (Huth, \nPetersen, & Lehman, 2013); however, no pacifiers, fingers, straws, spoons or any utensils can be used in the postoperative \nperiod for at least 7 days.\nFigure 14-6\u2002 Cleft palate. \n\u00a9 PeopleImages/E+/Getty\nFigure 14-5\u2002 Cleft lip. \n\u00a9 malost/Shutterstock\nFigure 14-7\u2002 A Logan bow is used to help maintain integrity of the suture lines. \nTABLE 14-1\u2003\nStructural Disorders (continued)\n\t\nInflammatory Disorders\t\n183\n", "TABLE 14-2\u2003\nObstructive Disorders\nHypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis\nDiagnosis: Hyphertrophic pyloric stenosis is the enlargement of the circular areas of muscle that surround the pyloric valve; \nthis hypertrophy blocks gastric emptying. After reaching approximately 3 weeks of age, the infant will present with increasing \nvomiting, which progresses to (potentially blood-tinged) projectile vomiting. The pediatric healthcare team may also identify \nthe hypertrophic tissue mass as an olive-shaped mass in the right upper abdominal quadrant. The child may present with visible \nperistalsis in the abdomen after eating and may also have dehydration and failure to thrive. The child may be very fussy, colicky, \nhungry after vomiting, distended, and in distress. Most vomiting occurs immediately after eating. Metabolic alkalosis may be \npresent due to loss of hydrochloric acid.\nRisk Factors: There are no known risk factors for this condition.\nTreatment: Surgical intervention is required to reduce the muscular hypertrophied tissue. In a pyloromyotomy, the muscle is \ntypically split with an incision along the anterior pylorus muscle. Preoperative care should include correction of fluid deficits \nand electrolyte imbalance, as these steps have been found to improve outcomes and reduce hospital stays (Wetherill, Melling, \nRhodes, Wilkinson, & Kenny, 2015). Postoperative care includes monitoring of vital signs, lab values, and respiratory and \nhydration status, while assessing wound healing of surgical or laparoscopic incisions. If oral food intake has not resumed before \ndischarge, parents will need education and written feeding instructions (James, Nelson, & Ashwill, 2013). \nIntussusception\nDiagnosis: The diagnosis of intussusception is made when a child presents with an acute abdomen and radiographs \ndemonstrate an invagination or telescoping of a segment of bowel into a section just distal. Children may present with acute \nabdominal pain that causes them to pull their knees to their chest as the pain comes and goes every 15-20 minutes lasting \nlonger with time (Mayo Clinic, 2016). This process usually occurs at the junction of the ileum with the lower colon. The most \ncommon age for clinical presentation of intussusception is between 5 months and 3 years, with 60% of patients being younger \nthan 1 year at diagnosis. Children may present with classic symptoms of bloody mucus stool (also referred to as red \u201ccurrant jelly\u201d \nstool) due to the obstructive nature of the process, dehydration, pain, distention, and vomiting (Figure 14-8).\nFigure 14-8\u2002 Intussusception. \nIntussuscipiens\n(receiver)\nIntussusceptum\nmuscular wall\nMucosa\nUS\nMucosa\n184\t\nChapter 14\u2003 Gastrointestinal Elimination\n", "Risk Factors: Risk factors include age (young children), gender (more common in boys) family history, and prior history of \nintussusceptions. The child may have experienced hyperactive peristalsis in the proximal portion of the bowel structure, \nwith overly inactive peristalsis in the distal intestinal segment. Both cystic fibrosis and celiac disease are risk factors for \nintussusception, although most cases have no known risk factors and the cause is unknown. \nTreatment: Treatment focuses on reducing the telescoping or invagination of the bowel, often with a barium enema or \nhydrostatic (water) enema. Ultrasound is typically used to determine the presence of this condition as well as the success of the \nreduction. Intussusception can cause severe edema and cut off blood supply, leading to ischemia and tissue death in the bowel, \nwhich in turn requires emergency medical care. Care prior to therapeutic reduction should include assessment for dehydration, \nshock, and sepsis; fever, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and alterations in consciousness or blood pressure being high-priority \nindicators of sepsis. Postreduction nursing care includes initiation of clear fluids and gradual reintroduction of normal diet, along \nwith monitoring for signs of success of the procedure, including passage of stool without blood and resumption of normal \nactivities without pain. Failure of reduction requires the child (and family) to be prepared for surgical intervention. Caregivers \nshould be educated about signs of recurrence, as intussusception recurs in approximately 10% of successful reductions and 2% \nto 5% of patients who undergo surgical correction (James et\u00a0al., 2013).\nHirschsprung Disease (Congenital Aganglionic Megacolon)\nDiagnosis: Hirschsprung disease is a structural anomaly of the lower segment of the large intestine and rectum. Its formal \nname of congenital aganglionic megacolon reflects its presentation (Hatfield, 2014): The condition is characterized by a lack of \nganglion cells (nerve tissue) in the rectum and lower colon that prevents peristalsis (hence \u201caganglionic\u201d). This segment of the \nbowel is narrower than it should be, which causes the section of bowel above it to become enlarged and filled with gas and \nfecal matter (hence \u201cmegacolon\u201d). Definitive diagnosis is made via rectal tissue biopsy, which will identify a lack of nerve tissue \n(Figure 14-9). Affected children will pass ribbon-like, foul-smelling stools. A key indicator of this condition is the lack of passage \nof stool in the newborn within 2 days.\nFigure 14-9\u2002 Features of Hirschprung disease compared to the normal sigmoid colon and rectum. \nNormal sigmoid colon and rectum\nEnlarged colon from\nHirschprung disease\nTABLE 14-2\u2003\nObstructive Disorders (continued)\n(continues)\n\t\nInflammatory Disorders\t\n185\n", "Risk Factors: There are no known risk factors for congenital Hirschsprung disease.\nTreatment: Treatment for this condition is surgery. Either the surgeon will perform a double-barrel colostomy to cut the \naganglionic section out and allow the megacolon time to heal and decrease in size, followed by a re-anastomosis, or the child \nwill have a rectal pull-through procedure in which the aganglionic segment of bowel is removed (D\u2019Cunha Burkardt, Graham, \nShort, & Frykman, 2013). Although children used to have multiple staged surgeries, single-stage surgeries involving a resection \nand pull-through via laparoscopic procedures is now more frequently performed (Huang, Tolley, Blakely, & Langham, 2013). \nNursing assessments focus on nutritional deficits, constipation, and coping capacity of the family confronted with a serious \nillness in the newborn (Hatfield, 2014). If the aganglionic portion extends to the small intestine, an ileostomy will be performed \nand the child may need sodium supplementation due to the loss of liquid stool through the ileostomy (O\u2019Neil, Teitelbaum, & \nHarris, 2014). Postoperative nursing goals include maintaining fluid balance and skin integrity, pain management, and preparing \nthe family for home care of the child (Hatfield, 2014).\nTABLE 14-3\u2003\nInflammatory Disorders\nAppendicitis\nDiagnosis: Appendicitis is the inflammation and infection of the appendix\u2019s vermiform, a small lymphoid tissue sac located at the \nend of the cecum. The inflammation and infection result from obstruction of the opening of the lumen by hardened fecal material, \nmicrobes, parasites, or foreign bodies. The subsequent accumulation of mucus causes the structure to become distended; venous \nengorgement occurs and pressure increases. Appendicitis can progress to rupture and peritonitis. The child may present with the \nclassic pain picture: local right lower quadrant pain at McBurney\u2019s point (just anterior and proximal to the lower ascending colon).\nRisk Factors: There are no known risk factors for appendicitis.\nTreatment: Treatment for appendicitis may be antibiotics, with or without surgery. A sudden relief of the persistent pain may \nmean the appendix has ruptured. If antibiotic therapy is used, nursing care includes management of caregiver anxiety (which \nwill likely be considerable) as well as management of the patient\u2019s pain and fever. Monitor for dehydration and sudden cessation \nof pain (which often means rupture and increased risk of complications). If surgery is indicated, relieving fear, managing \npain, and maintaining fluid balance are primary preoperative goals; postoperative recovery is generally without incident, but \ncaregivers should be educated about home care and signs of complications such as peritonitis (Hatfield, 2014). \nCeliac Disease (Gluten-Sensitivity Enteropathy)\nDiagnosis: In celiac disease (a condition that is becoming more common), the child has a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that \nleads to malabsorption due to an immune-mediated enteropathy (inflammation of tissues and gastric/intestinal villi atrophy). \nThe child cannot digest glutenin, gliadin, or proteins from wheat, barley, rye, and sometimes oats. The child may present with \nsteatorrhea (fatty, bulky, greasy, and malodorous stools), distention, abdominal pain, anemia, and growth delay. During a celiac \ncrisis, the child may present with severe diarrhea, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances. Extra-intestinal \nmanifestations may include osteoporosis, arthralgia, peripheral neuropathies, cardiomyopathy, and anemia. The condition is \nconsidered an autoimmune disorder requiring multiple screening tools via biopsies and seriological tests (Ryan & Grossman, \n2011). A diagnosis is made by a 72-hour fecal fat collection and lab analysis of total immunoglobulin A (IgA), antigliadin \nantibody (AGA), and reticulin antibody levels. A biopsy of mucosal tissue for an assessment of villi atrophy and flat surfaces is \ndiagnostic. \nRisk Factors: Both environmental factors and an inherited predisposition are risk factors for celiac disease. Children also may \nhave an abnormal immunologic reaction.\nTreatment: Lifelong dietary modifications are the most important consideration in treating celiac disease. Diets considered \n\u201cgluten-free\u201d can still incorporate grains, such as rice, corn, 100% cornmeal (some commercial \u201ccornmeal\u201d preparations contain \nwheat products), and gluten-free wheat flour. Note that some nonfood products, such as cosmetics or medications, may include \ngluten. Caregivers should be instructed in how to examine labels and avoid gluten-containing products, as the child with \nceliac disease must adhere to gluten avoidance guidelines. Long-term compliance with a gluten-free diet can be assessed by \nfollowing a child\u2019s celiac disease-related antibodies (serological testing) (Nachman et\u00a0al., 2011). Children may need mineral and \nvitamin supplements such as A, D, E, and K vitamins, as well as iron and folic acid.\nTABLE 14-2\u2003\nObstructive Disorders (continued)\n186\t\nChapter 14\u2003 Gastrointestinal Elimination\n", "Crohn Disease\nDiagnosis: A child with Crohn disease (inflammation of all layers of the GI mucosa, affecting any portion of the GI tract) \nwill experience increased hyperemia in the GI mucosa, easy bleeding of the intestinal wall, and ulceration of the GI tract \n(any part). The child may present with diarrhea, weight loss, bloody stools, abdominal pain, anemia, dehydration, and fever. \nDiagnosis is made by mucosal biopsy during a colonoscopy, stool analysis for blood, and blood analysis for complete blood \ncount (CBC), ESR, albumin and total protein. The typical presentation of ulcers associated with Crohn disease consists of \n\u201cskip\u201d lesions with normal tissue found on either side. As the disease progresses, ulcers merge to form star-shaped \u201cstellate\u201d \nulcers; in advanced disease, a \u201ccobblestone\u201d appearance is present (Richards, 2015). Some children with acute disease have \nextra-intestinal manifestations such as joint swelling, joint pain, rashes, mouth sores, inflammation of the eyes, kidney stones, \ninflamed pancreas, bone disease, and abnormal liver function tests.\nRisk Factors: There is no exact etiology or known risk factors for Crohn disease.\nTreatment: Children with an acute episode of Crohn disease will need rest, fluids, and anti-inflammatory medications. In severe \nconditions, a partial colectomy may be required to surgically remove the ulcerated bowel tissue; this procedure has been found \nto be curative for some children with Crohn disease. Children with malnutrition symptoms may be placed on IV total parenteral \nnutrition (TPN) and lipids. Changes in diet are required, including eliminating consumption of foods that are associated with \nincreasing ulcerations and discomfort\u2014specifically, sharp cheeses; highly spiced foods; salted, blackened, or smoked meats; raw \nfruits; raw vegetables; and fried foods.\nUlcerative Colitis\nDiagnosis: Unlike Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis (UC) is localized to the colon (i.e., inflammation of the colonic mucosa). \nChildren with UC present with urgent diarrhea, weight loss, bloody stools, abdominal pain, anemia, dehydration, and fever. \nDiagnosis is made by mucosal biopsy during a colonoscopy, stool analysis for blood, and blood analysis for CBC, ESR, albumin, \nand total protein. The classic presentation of ulcerative colitis consists of continuous ulcers (not skip lesions, as in Crohn disease), \nwith only the innermost layer of the bowel mucosa being affected; lesions generally start proximal to the rectum and extend up \ninto the bowel over time (Hindryckx, Jairath, & D\u2019Haens, 2016). Children with acute exacerbations can have as many as 10 stools \nper day. Extra-intestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis can include joint pain, rashes, and abnormal liver function tests.\nRisk Factors: There is no exact etiology or known risk factors for ulcerative colitis.\nTreatment: Children with an acute episode of ulcerative colitis will need rest, fluids, and anti-inflammatory medications. In \nsevere cases, a partial colectomy may be required to surgically remove the ulcerated bowel tissue. Children with malnutrition \nsymptoms may be placed on IV TPN and lipids. Changes in diet are required, including eliminating consumption of foods that \nare associated with increasing ulcerations and discomfort\u2014specifically, sharp cheeses; highly spiced foods; salted, blackened, or \nsmoked meats; raw fruits; raw vegetables; and fried foods.\nFunctional Disorders\nCommon functional disorders of the GI system include \ndiarrhea, vomiting, and constipation. These disorders can \nbe mild, requiring support that can be provided at home, \nor they can be significant enough to cause moderate dehy-\ndration, leading to the need for interventions in the clinic \nsetting, or severe dehydration, requiring hospitalization \nand monitoring. Constipation can be either mild or severe \nenough to require further diagnosis for the etiology and \nmedical treatment.\nTABLE 14-3\u2003\nInflammatory Disorders (continued)\nPHARMACOLOGY\nMedications Used to Treat Chronic Inflammation  \nof the GI Tract\nDrugs used to treat inflammatory bowel disease are \n\u00adcategorized into three types:\n\u2022\t Mild symptoms: aminosalicylates\n\u25c6\u25c6Mesalamine (Asacol, Lialda, Rowasa, Canasa)\n\u25c6\u25c6Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)\n\u2022\t Moderate symptoms: corticosteroids\n\u25c6\u25c6Prednisolone (Orapred)\n\u25c6\u25c6Prednisone (Sterapred)\n\u2022\t Severe symptoms: immunomodulators\n\u25c6\u25c6Infliximab infusion (Remicade) \n\t\nFunctional Disorders\t\n187\n", "Constipation\nDiagnosis\nConstipation is a term used to denote the infrequent and \ndifficult passage of stool. Each child has a unique stooling pat-\ntern, so it is imperative to ask the family to describe the child\u2019s \nnormal stooling process. Constipation is typically diagnosed \nwhen a child has difficulty passing a series of small, hard stools \nwhile experiencing abdominal pain and possibly cramping.\nRisk Factors\nChildren who have limited daily fluid intake, sedentary lifestyles, \nand poor fiber intake are at risk for developing constipation. \nOther risk factors can include the consumption of foods known \nto cause hardened stool, such as excessive dairy products. \nSevere and chronic constipation may be associated with lead \npoisoning, underactive thyroid function, celiac disease, and \nabnormal serum calcium levels (Tabbers et\u00a0al., 2014).\nTreatment\nDietary changes to increase fiber are considered first in children \nwith constipation. These changes include increased intake of \nfresh fruits, dried fruits, vegetables, whole high-fiber grains, \nand oral fluids. If these measures are not successful in reliev-\ning constipation, the next step is to administer medications \nthat increase water release (stool softeners) into the bowel, \nfollowed by the use of enemas to assist in the expelling of \nthe hard stool, followed by laxatives that increase peristalsis.\nAcute Diarrhea\nDiagnosis\nAcute diarrhea has many potential causes, including exposure \nto infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites. \nAntibiotic use and the presence of an upper respiratory \ninfection or a urinary tract infection may cause acute \ndiarrhea in some children. Infectious gastroenteritis, also \ncalled acute gastroenteritis (AGE), can cause significant \ndehydration. Pathogens implicated in acute diarrhea include \nrotavirus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Salmonella \nenterica, and Giardia lamblia. Signs and symptoms of acute \ndiarrhea include the following manifestations:\n\u2022\t Increased intestinal motility and rapid emptying, \nleading to frequent loose or liquid stools that may \nbe foul smelling\n\u2022\t Dry, pale skin with poor turgor (tenting of skin) \nand dry mucous membranes due to loss of water\n\u2022\t Weakness associated with electrolyte imbalances \n(sodium and potassium)\n\u2022\t Decreased urine output\n\u2022\t Change in vital signs including tachycardia; tachy-\npnea can occur with severe dehydration causing \nacidosis, and hypotension can occur with severe \ndehydration\n\u2022\t Increased thirst\n\u2022\t Acid\u2012base imbalances, including alkalosis due to \nbuffered bicarbonate loss\nRisk Factors\nChildren who have traveled, attend daycare centers, live in \nsubstandard housing lacking proper sanitation, have been \nexposed to a causative agent, or have poor hand hygiene \nare at risk for acute diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea is typically \nassociated with malabsorption syndrome, lactose intoler-\nance, inflammatory bowel disease, and food allergens.\nTreatment\nTreatment for acute diarrhea should start prior to a defini-\ntive diagnosis if the child is becoming dehydrated from \nfrequent loose or watery stools. Oral rehydration therapy \nshould be initiated or, if the child unable to take oral fluids, \nIV replacement therapy should be started. Administration \nof oral rehydrating solution (ORS) should begin at a rate of \n40 to 50 mL/kg per 24 hours, with an additional replace-\nment for each diarrheal stool given at 10 mL/kg. Medica-\ntions will be specific for the etiology of the acute diarrhea \nisolated in stool cultures. Commonly used medications \ninclude metronidazole (Flagyl) and sulfamethoxazole\u2012\ntrimethoprim (Bactrim or Septra). Oral fluids should not \ncontain sugar. Fruit juices, sodas, gelatin, or any fluids with \ncaffeine should be avoided.\n UNIQUE FOR KIDS\nIntroducing Fluids and Foods in a Child with a \nDiagnosis of Diarrhea or Vomiting\nChildren with vomiting can benefit from an NPO (nil per \nos, meaning \u201cnothing by mouth\u201d) status until vomiting \nstops for a period of time. In young children with diarrhea, \nbreastfeeding should be continued if possible.\nAn electrolyte-based oral rehydration fluid such as Pedialyte \nis often used first in children with vomiting or diarrhea. If toler-\nated, favorite fluids can be mixed with oral rehydration fluids; \nin infancy, the rehydration fluids can be mixed with formula \nor breast milk. Products such as Pedialyte also come in gelatin \nand popsicles. After oral fluids are established, the BRATTY \ndiet can be introduced (though it remains controversial due \nto its low nutritional value):\n\u2022\t Bananas\n\u2022\t Rice cereal or dry cereal of choice (e.g., Cheerios)\n\u2022\t Applesauce without added sugar (sugar can cause \nfluid to enter the bowel, increasing diarrhea)\n\u2022\t Toast without butter\n\u2022\t Tea: caffeine-free herbal varieties (e.g., chamomile)\n\u2022\t Yogurt: plain or with low-sugar fruit flavors\n188\t\nChapter 14\u2003 Gastrointestinal Elimination\n", "Other Disorders Affecting Elimination\nHyperbilirubinemia\nHyperbilirubinemia, or jaundice, refers to a yellow discolor-\nation of the skin caused by the deposition of unconjugated \nbilirubin in the skin.

When vomiting is also associated with fever and \ndiarrhea, an acute infectious process should be ruled out.\nTreatment\nTreatment for vomiting is typically not needed unless \nthe experience persists, leading to complications such as \ndehydration, electrolyte imbalances, aspiration and, with \nextensive vomiting, malnutrition or failure to thrive.\nVomiting\nDiagnosis\nVomiting\u2014the forceful expulsion of gastric contents through \nthe mouth\u2014is very common in young children. It is quite \noften self-limiting, with rapid resolution.\nRisk Factors\nFactors associated with vomiting include infectious disease, \ntoxic material ingestion, allergy, obstruction, or increased \nintracranial pressure (ICP). Vomiting can also be psychogenic \nFAMILY EDUCATION\nThe Child with Encopresis\nEncopresis is a medical diagnosis in which a child holds \nonto his or her stool, causing the lower colon and rectum \nto become enlarged and stretched. Considered a type of \nchronic constipation, this condition is characterized by liquid \nstool leaking around a large mass of stool, staining the child\u2019s \nunderwear. The condition can last for months or years and \nrequires a concerted effort by supportive family members to \nencourage the child to produce a stool every day. Multiple \ntheories have been proposed for why this condition occurs, \nmany of which relate to the child\u2019s affect and emotional state.\nRecommendations for managing encopresis are for the child \nto sit on the toilet 2 to 3 times a day for 5 to 10 minutes after meals; \nthe child should be given support and encouragement\u2014never \npunishment or demeaning comments\u2014until the child produces \nat least a half-cup of stool daily. The child must be encouraged \nto drink plenty of liquids every day and to increase fiber intake \ndaily through consumption of fruits and fiber-rich cereals. Some \nchildren may need stool softeners to pass the accumulated mass.\nEncopresis occurs in as many as 1 in 100 children and can \ncause a family great distress when the child suddenly passes \na stool in the clothing. Children can be bullied and ridiculed \nat school if they are incontinent or if they smell like feces.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nA\nccording to Youssef et\u00a0al. (2005), children with chronic \nconstipation have a reduced quality of life as compared \nto children with other GI conditions such as reflux and inflam-\nmatory bowel disease. Longer periods of time with symptoms \nassociated with chronic constipation are correlated with lower \nquality of life scores. Clinicians should be mindful of the high \nlevel of parental concern that arises when children have this \ncondition, often related to psychosocial aspects of caregiving \nand the parents\u2019 own experiences with the condition.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\u2002\nContact and Expanded Contact Precautions\nChildren who present with vomiting and/or diarrhea should \nimmediately be placed on contact precautions.\n\u2022\t Contact precautions require the use of gloves, gown \nand strict hand hygiene (can be alcohol-based hand \ngels).\n\u2022\t Expanded contact precautions are used for GI infec-\ntions involving Clostridium difficile. Hand hygiene re-\nquires hand washing rather than use of alcohol-based \nhand gels.\nBEST PRACTICES\nAssessment of Dehydration Across Childhood\nMild Dehydration\nClinical manifestations may be absent or not overt. Assess for \ncapillary refill time (more than 2 seconds suggests dehydra-\ntion), skin turgor, abnormal respiratory pattern, and a generally \nill appearance. Specifically, look for dry mucous membranes, \nparticularly absence of tears.\nModerate to Severe Dehydration\n\u2022\t Neonates: Crying, dry diaper, sunken fontanels, \nsunken eyes, tachycardia\n\u2022\t Infants: Crying and irritability, dry diaper, sunken an-\nterior fontanel, lack of tears, dry mucous membranes, \ncapillary refill time more than 3 seconds, tachycardia\n\u2022\t Toddlers: Increased thirst, irritability, decreased urine \noutput, lethargy, tachycardia, oliguria, urine specific \ngravity greater than 1.030\n\u2022\t Older children: Headaches, decreased urine output, \npoor turgor, fatigue, tachycardia, oliguria, urine \n\u00adspecific gravity more than 1.030\n\t\nOther Disorders Affecting Elimination\t\n189\n", "Treatment\nThe application of fluorescent light (420\u2012448 nm) to \nthe neonate\u2019s exposed body surface area assists in the \nbreakdown of bilirubin, which is then transported to \nthe liver (Figure 14-10). The baby\u2019s skin absorbs light \nof this wavelength, which then changes the chemistry of \nbilirubin by oxidizing it into biliverdin (water soluble) \nfor transport and direct excretion. Treatment can be \nstopped once serum bilirubin levels demonstrate a trend-\ning down (without rebound) or when the level is less \nthan 10 mg/dL.\nbe processed by the liver (conjugated) and excreted by the \nkidneys; it plays a role in the breakdown of red blood cells. \nAdequate serum protein is required to transport bilirubin \nfrom the body to the liver, where it is transformed into a \nwater-soluble substance and eliminated in the urine or feces.\nDiagnosis\nSerum bilirubin levels are taken during the newborn period \nvia laboratory analysis of blood obtained from a heel stick. \nNormal expected levels are less than 5 mg/dL for newborns; \nthe diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia is made when the serum \nlevel reaches or exceeds 15 mg/dL (Porter & Dennis, 2002). \nBoth direct bilirubin levels (bilirubin that is bound to serum \nprotein and can be excreted) and indirect bilirubin levels \n(bilirubin that is circulating in blood) may be drawn.\nRisk Factors\nJaundice in the newborn period is common. There are \nfour types of jaundice:\n\u2022\t Breastfeeding jaundice: This type occurs when a \nnewborn\u2019s total intake of breast milk is insufficient \nto provide enough protein to transport biliru-\nbin. The incidence is between 5% and 10% of all \nnewborns.\n\u2022\t Physiological jaundice: The most common type of \njaundice, this condition affects as many as 50% of \nall newborns. In physiological jaundice, the im-\nmature liver is unable to process the quantity of \nbilirubin transported. Jaundice first appears in the \nsecond or third day of life and decreases and disap-\npears by the end of the first to second week of life.\n\u2022\t Breast milk jaundice: This type of jaundice is relatively \nrare, accounting for less than 1% of all cases. In this \ncondition, a substance found in the mother\u2019s milk \ncauses an increased uptake of bilirubin back into the \ninfant\u2019s bloodstream from the intestines, where it is \nbeing secreted. Levels are typically not harmful, but \nthe jaundice can persist for 3 to 11 weeks.\n\u2022\t Blood group (Rh or ABO) incompatibility: The sud-\nden and severe hemolysis associated with blood \ngroup incompatibility causes the most severe form of \njaundice.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nT\no prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia associated with \nblood group incompatibility, the mother should receive \na Rhogam intramuscular (IM) injection within 72 hours of \ndelivery. This preventive medication will stop the formation \nof antibodies that could cause severe harm, or death, from \nsubsequent pregnancies.\nFigure 14-10\u2002 A newborn under bili lights for hyperbilirubinemia. \n\u00a9 Melpomene/Shutterstock\nBEST PRACTICES\nMaintenance of Phototherapy: Skills Required\nThe following nursing skills are associated with the care of a \nchild with hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy:\n\u2022\t Immediate placement upon admission to the pediatric \nunit\n\u2022\t Assessment of phototherapy light intensity\n\u2022\t Securing eye protection to prevent retina damage \nfrom the phototherapy\n\u2022\t Frequent assessment for dehydration, as infants may \nrequire 10% to 20% more fluid\n\u2022\t Monitoring length of breastfeeding episodes\u2014should \nbe no more than 30 minutes every 3 hours or on \ndemand\n\u2022\t Educating the family on the rationale for photother-\napy, to increase compliance\n\u2022\tEducating the family on the potential need for \n\u00adserial heel sticks to monitor for serum \u00adbilirubin \n\u00adlevels, often every 12 to 24 hours or more \n\u00adfrequently as ordered\n190\t\nChapter 14\u2003 Gastrointestinal Elimination\n", " Failure to Thrive \n Failure to thrive (FTT) is not considered an actual medical \ndiagnosis, but rather a condition secondary to a medical or \nemotional/aff ective disorder. It is a serious complication of \ngastrointestinal disorders and diseases, and is associated \nwith high morbidity and mortality rates.   \n RESEARCH EVIDENCE \n Prevention of Neurotoxicity: Kernicterus \nKernicterus is a condition in which the neonate\u2019s bilirubin \nlevels are high enough to become absorbed by the brain \ntissue, potentially causing severe brain damage. Early-stage \nsymptoms of kernicterus include poor feeding, lethargy, \nand hypotonia. Mid-stage symptoms include high-pitched \ncry, abnormal arching and posturing (opisthotonus), and \n eventually visual (strabismus and upgazing) and hearing \nimpairment or loss, also known as auditory neuropathy \n(Shapiro, 2005). The infant may develop fevers and  convulsions \n(Kenner & Lott, 2013). Progression leads to more serious brain \ndamage. An infant at risk for kernicterus will need rapid pho-\ntotherapy with bili lights or a biliblanket that can be increased \nto double or triple lights. Exchange transfusions may be \n required in infants with severely high bilirubin levels. \n QUALITY AND SAFETY \n Diagnosing and Managing Failure to Thrive \n A child who presents with two or more (or consistent) growth \nplot points below the 5th percentile should be evaluated for \nthe complexities of failure to thrive. The healthcare team should \ntrack weight-for-length, weight-for-age, and length-for-age, \nas well as head circumference and abdominal circumference \nwhile assessing for FTT (Dubowitz & Black, 2010). It takes a team \napproach involving several healthcare professionals to assist a \nchild with FTT, given the wide range of health and psychosocial \nsituations that can contribute to this condition (Iwaniec, 2004). \n Two major categories of FTT are distinguished: organic, in \nwhich a pathological cause can be identifi ed, and non-organic, \nin which no anatomic, functional, or pathological etiology is \nidentifi ed. Many children have mixed etiologies (Homan, 2016) \nbecause organic factors can trigger non-organic factors, such \nas familial stress. Assessment for organic factors includes a \nworkup for pathological conditions that could decrease the \nabsorption or metabolism of nutrients and calories. Assess-\nment for non-organic FTT includes evaluation of the child \nand family for educational levels, fi nancial challenges, family \nor individual stressors, mental health issues, child abuse, and \nother aff ective infl uences leading to poor nutrition, decreased \nintake, or intentional or unintentional neglect (Homan, 2016). \n Case Study \n The nurse is meeting a 4-year-old East Indian child for the fi rst \ntime; the child is being admitted for his monthly Remicade \n(infl iximab) infusion for his chronic Crohn disease. In the past, \nthe family has been cared for by a diff erent GI team in a rural \narea of Northern California. Due to the chronic nature of his \nsymptoms, his progressive and alarming weight loss, and his \ndelayed growth and development, the child is now being \nadmitted to a large urban hospital that has a GI specialty team. \nThe hospital is more than a 3-hour drive from the family\u2019s \nhome.

Each child has a unique pattern of growth, de-\nvelopment, and elimination.\n\u25c6\u25c6The development of the GI system begins in the 4th \nfetal week of gestation. The intestinal lining includes \nmultiple layers: the epithelium, mucosa with goblet \nmucus-producing cells, submucosa, circular muscular \nlayer, longitudinal muscular layer, and serosa (intra-\nperitoneal) or adventitia (retroperitoneal).\n\u25c6\u25c6One of the critical aspects of the development of the \nnewborn\u2019s host defenses is the intestinal tract\u2019s coloniza-\ntion with bacteria (especially Bacteroides) that produce \nvitamin K. Newborns have a higher (but rare) risk of \nbleeding due to their innately low stores of vitamin K, \nwhich is required for coagulation processes.\n\u25c6\u25c6Many disorders related to elimination can cause a child \nto become dehydrated. Mild dehydration is defined as a \nweight loss of 5% or less in infants and a 3% to 4% weight \nloss in children; moderate dehydration is defined as a 10% \nweight loss in infants and a 6% to 8% weight loss in children; \nand severe dehydration is defined as a 15% weight loss in \ninfants and a 10% weight loss in children. There are three \ntypes of dehydration: isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic.\n\u25c6\u25c6Common health concerns and disorders within the GI \nsystem include structural disorders, obstructive disor-\nders, inflammatory disorders, and functional disorders.\n\u25c6\u25c6Pediatric structural gastrointestinal disorders include \nhernias, anorectal malformations, gastroesophageal \nreflux, cleft lip, and cleft palate.\n\u25c6\u25c6Pediatric gastrointestinal obstructive disorders include \nhypertrophic pyloric stenosis, intussusception, and \nHirschsprung disease.\nCase Study\u2002 (continued)\nC.\t Physical assessment including height, weight, and \nabdominal circumference; hydration status including \nmucous membrane moisture, turgor, and presence \nof tears; and quality of the child\u2019s peripheral pulses\nD.\t Colonoscopy and biopsy to confirm Crohn diagnosis\nThe child has undergone a physical assessment and com-\nplete history.

Based on the records from his previous \nvisit, the child has lost approximately 1 kg and now weighs a \nlittle more than 13 kg. During history taking, the father again \nexpresses his unhappiness at the lack of consistent care his \nchild has received and the fact that obtaining comprehensive \ncare requires extended travel.

Most \nof these disorders are associated with particular ethnicities, \nsuch that their prevalence is greater within those popula\u00ad\ntions. Families from particular ethnic groups with higher \nincidence of a metabolic disorder should be screened for the \nassociated errors; in addition, any family with a history of a \nmetabolic disorder should be offered an expanded version \nof the standard metabolic screening mandated by the state.\nThe physiologic effects of these disorders can be orga\u00ad\nnized into three distinct groups:\n\u2022\t Disorders that disrupt synthesis or catabolism \nof complex molecules not related to food intake, \nincluding metabolic disorders associated with in\u00ad\ntracellular transport, intracellular processing, and \nlysosomal disorders\n\u2022\t Disorders that lead to a deficiency of energy pro\u00ad\nduction, including disorders affecting the liver, \nbrain, myocardium, or muscles\u2019 ability to utilize or \nproduce energy\nIntroduction\nA metabolic condition is characterized by a defect or \n\u00addisruption in the biochemical process of a metabolic path\u00ad\nway. The major metabolic pathways in the body \u00adcomprise \nthe complex mechanisms of carbohydrate, lipid, and \nprotein synthesis or catabolism, as well as the production, \nsecretion, and mechanism of action of various hormones; \ncollectively, the chemical reactions that occur via these \npathways are termed metabolism. A genetic defect in any \npart of this complex biochemical process leads to a metabolic \ncondition referred to as an inborn error of metabolism or \na hormonal imbalance. Such conditions can be mild or \nsevere, and have the potential to disrupt expected growth, \ndevelopment, and mental processing. Some conditions, if \nleft untreated, may be fatal.\nEndocrine Dysfunction\nThe human body relies on a complex and integral system \nof checks and balances. Hormones, which are released \nby the glands in minute quantities into the bloodstream, \nare substances that serve as chemical messengers in the \nbody. The fine balance of hormone secretion allows the \nbody to receive messages concerning fluid and electrolyte \nbalance, growth, energy production and consumption, \nsexual organ development, and rapid responses to stress\u00ad\nful or dangerous stimuli. Any disruption to the complex \nendocrine system\u2014whether it is caused by familial or \ngenetic factors or is acquired due to an injury, trauma, or \nother factors\u2014has a huge impact on the growing child\u2019s \nphysiological balance and well-being.\nPediatric metabolic disorders are rare, with an average \noverall incidence rate of fewer than 1 case per 1 million \npopulation for extremely rare conditions, 1 case per 250,000 \npopulation for very rare conditions (e.g., maple syrup \nurine disease), and 1 case per 6000 to 60,000 population \nfor more common but still relatively rare conditions (e.g., \nphenylketonuria, galactosemia). Although more than 1000 \ninherited disorders of metabolism have been identified to \ndate, and more than 1400 metabolic disorders in general, \nthe incidence of these conditions is relatively small.\nIn all U.S. states, newborn screening for at least 26 meta\u00ad\nbolic disorders is required. Some states require between 30 \nand 50 tests for inborn errors of metabolism, with repeat \nconfirmatory testing being performed if the initial values \nare positive. Tandem mass spectrometry is widely used for \nthis purpose because it is sensitive enough to detect many \nerrors and requires only a minimal volume of blood for \ntesting; the sample is usually drawn via a heel stick before \nthe newborn leaves the hospital (Figure 15-1). Aggressive \nscreening of all newborns allows for early identification \nFigure 15-1\u2002 Drawing a blood sample from a newborn via a heel stick. \nLateral\nplantar artery\nMedial\nplantar artery\n\t\nEndocrine Dysfunction\t\n195\n", "TABLE 15-1\u2003\nMetabolic Pathways\nSubstance\nProcess\nImperative\nProteins\nAmino acids undergo gluconeogenesis to pyruvate, which \nproduces acetyl-CoA.\nIn the Krebs cycle, ATP is formed from acetyl-CoA to produce \nenergy.\nWithout protein gluconeogenesis, the \nchild cannot grow, heal tissues, or have \norgan function.\nLipids\nLipids provide glycerol, triglycerides, and fatty acids.

Treatment \n\u00adtypically involves four types of interventions:\n\u2022\t Altering the child\u2019s nutrition to remove a diet com\u00ad\nponent causing toxic accumulations\n\u2022\t Providing large doses of vitamins to induce metab\u00ad\nolism in such disorders as maple syrup urine dis\u00ad\nease (administering thiamine) or oxidation defects \n(administering riboflavin)\n\u2022\t Toxin removal by way of hemofiltration, hemo\u00ad\ndialysis, or peritoneal dialysis (such as removing \ntoxic levels of ammonia associated with urea cycle \ndefects)\n\u2022\t Providing a simulated alternative metabolic path\u00ad\nway via drug therapy (such as the administration of \nsodium benzoate for urea cycle errors)\nIf the infant or child has an acute and life-threatening \ncondition associated with a metabolic dysfunction or \ndisorder, immediate emergency management may be \nrequired. This may include a rapid admission to a pe\u00ad\ndiatric intensive care unit and ventilation of the child if \nmetabolic acidosis is severe enough to affect breathing \n(Figure 15-2). Further emergency management may \ninclude correcting electrolyte imbalances, correcting \nmetabolic acidosis, rehydration, total parenteral nutrition \n(TPN), and suppression of toxic metabolite production \nvia drug therapy (Table 15-3).\na late-onset metabolic disorder, a viral infection or other \nfever-related or diarrhea-related pathology may start the \nprocess leading to presentation.\nFigure 15-2\u2002 An infant in a NICU with ventilation. \n\u00a9 guvendemir/iStock/Getty Images\n198\t\nChapter 15\u2003 Metabolism\n", "Phenylketonuria\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism \nthat has an incidence rate of 1 case per 15,000 live births \n(Raghuveer et\u00a0al., 2006). Children with PKU lack the enzyme \nphenylalanine hydroxylase and therefore are unable to convert \nphenylalanine\u2014an essential amino acid consumed in the diet \nthat is typically used for \u00adprotein synthesis\u2014to tyrosine in \nthe liver. This autosomal \u00adrecessive genetic disorder involves \na defect in metabolism of amino acids that leads to the ac\u00ad\ncumulation of toxic metabolites called phenylketones. When \nplasma concentrations of phenylketones reach 20 mg/dL, \nthey spill into the urine, which is the finding that gives this \ndisorder its name. The phenylketones themselves are not \nwhat cause central nervous system (CNS) \u00adsymptoms and \neventual neurologic damage; rather, it is the accumulation \nof phenylalanine (hyperphenylalaninemia) that \u00addamages \nbrain tissue and, ultimately, produces cognitive impairment.\nExcessive vomiting may be a first clinical sign of PKU. \nWithout identification of this disorder, medical management, \nand health education, the child with PKU may experience \nlearning disabilities, hyperactivity, developmental delay, \nand, in the older child, intellectual disability, behavior \nproblems, seizures, and other neurological and psychiatric \ndisorders (Mayo Clinic, 2014).\nMedical Management\nThe primary medical management trajectory for a diagnosis \nof PKU is early identification of the pathology and then \ndietary removal of foods that contain phenylalanine\u2014that \nis, elimination of most meats, dairy, nuts, and legumes \nfrom the diet, as well as restriction of portions of starches \nsuch as potatoes, corn, and bread (Arnold & Steiner, 2014) \n(Figure 15-3). Avoiding foods and medications contain\u00ad\ning the sweetener aspartame (l-aspartylphenylalanine) is \nNursing Care\nBesides immediately reporting any suspicious neonatal \nor infant behaviors associated with an error or pathology \nof the metabolic pathways, the primary responsibility of \nthe nurse is to educate the family about all aspects of the \nchild\u2019s lifelong care. Essential elements of that education \ninclude communicating and confirming an understand\u00ad\ning of the complexity of the disorder on a level that aligns \nwith the family\u2019s level of health literacy. Because each adult \nhas his or her own way of learning, several teaching tech\u00ad\nniques should be implemented. Using a variety of teaching \n\u00admethods\u2014including verbal explanations, written materials, \nand video education tools\u2014will help to confirm the care\u00ad\ngiver\u2019s understanding of the needed dietary modifications, \nmedication adherence, and clinical signs of complications. \nFor instance, when teaching a family about the pathology \nof Gaucher syndrome, the family needs to understand the \ndisorder itself, how to safely and accurately administer \ndrug therapy to provide the missing metabolic enzyme (a \nsubstance that catalyzes a chemical reaction, but is itself \nunchanged by the reaction), which periodic laboratory \nanalyses and diagnostics are needed for surveillance, and \nwhich symptoms are associated with progressive disease \nand need to be reported to the healthcare team.\nMetabolic Concept Exemplars\nGiven that so many metabolic conditions exist, but most \nare rarely encountered, the pediatric nurse should be\u00ad\ncome familiar with those metabolic disorders that are \nmore commonly seen. Exemplars for this chapter include \ntwo inborn errors of metabolism\u2014phenylketonuria and \ngalactosemia\u2014as well as the endocrine dysfunction of \ndiabetes mellitus.\nTABLE 15-3\u2003\nDrug Therapy for Inborn Errors of Metabolism\nAmino Acid Errors\n\u203a\u203a\nExample: Nonketonic hyperglycemia\n\u203a\u203a\nDrug therapy: Sodium benzoate, ketamine, dextromethorphan\nUrea Cycle Errors\n\u203a\u203a\nExample: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency\n\u203a\u203a\nDrug therapy: IV sodium benzoate, arginine, carglumic acid\nOrganic Acidemia Errors\n\u203a\u203a\nExample: Methylmalonic acidema\n\u203a\u203a\nDrug therapy: l-Carnitine, cobalamin\nLysosomal Storage Errors\n\u203a\u203a\nExample: Gaucher disease\n\u203a\u203a\nDrug therapy: Miglustat, alglucerase\n\t\nMetabolic Concept Exemplars\t\n199\n", "accurate results, newborns should be screened within the \nfirst 24 to 48 hours of life after a protein feeding.\nGalactosemia\nGalactosemia is an inborn error of metabolism that \noccurs when a child is unable to convert galactose, a \nsimple carbohydrate found in dairy products and milk, to \nglucose-1-phosphate. A deficiency in the enzyme galactose-\n1-phosphate uridyl transferase leads to the accumulation of \ngalactose. Symptoms of the defect begin to present within \nthe first few days of life after the consumption of milk feeds. \nThey include vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hypoglycemia, \nand liver dysfunction, progressing to cataract formation, \nabnormal clotting, failure to thrive, and eventually cogni\u00ad\ntive impairment.\nMedical Management\nThe only medical treatment for galactosemia is the elimi\u00ad\nnation of galactose (usually present as the disaccharide \nlactose, which is composed of glucose and galactose and \nis the major carbohydrate in milk) from the diet. Infants \nneed to be fed soy-based formula, as galactose is present \neven in breast milk (Figure 15-4).\nNursing Care\nThe pediatric nurse must be knowledgeable about the \nclinical signs and symptoms of galactosemia. Being able \nto identify key indicators early can preserve mental func\u00ad\ntioning and save lives. High levels of galactose due to a \nreduction or absence of enzymes required for metaboliz\u00ad\ning galactose requires monitoring for abnormal results on \nliver and kidney function tests. Identifying early signs of \npediatric lens disorder is imperative, as the accumulation \nof the toxic metabolite puts children at increased risk for \ncataracts. Overall, children with galactosemia have lower \nimperative to prevent severe health complications; most \nof these items are \u201cdiet\u201d or \u201clow-carb\u201d formulations, so \nparents should read product labels carefully. Baby formulas, \nformulas required for older children, and premade infant \nfoods must also be phenylalanine free.\nNursing Care\nBecause PKU is treated through dietary restrictions alone, \nfamily education is the key to astute nursing care. Teaching \nthe family and caregivers of a child with PKU to avoid food \nor drinks containing phenylalanine is of primary impor\u00ad\ntance. The nurse should initiate an immediate referral to \na nutritionist to assist in the education and reinforcement \nof information throughout childhood.\nSpecial bottle-feeding formulas are available for chil\u00ad\ndren with PKU. Older children should adhere to a diet \nthat is low in milk and dairy products, meat, chicken, fish, \nnuts, beans, eggs, and high-protein foods. This diet must \nbe followed for life. Processed foods to avoid include the \nfollowing items:\n\u2022\t High-protein formulas (infants with PKU require a \nspecialized infant formula)\n\u2022\t Artificial sweeteners containing phenylalanine (e.g., \naspartame [Equal])\n\u2022\t \u201cSugar-free\u201d juices or carbonated beverages, includ\u00ad\ning flavored waters, that contain phenylalanine in \nthe form of aspartame\n\u2022\t Processed foods prepared with phenylalanine\n\u2022\t Candy, sweets, ice cream, or other \u201cdiet foods\u201d that \ncontain phenylalanine\nScreening for potential inborn errors of metabolism \nis important for the early identification of PKU.

Hormones, which are naturally \nsecreted in miniscule quantities, have very specific functions \nand act on specific target receptors; the hormone\u2012receptor \ncomplex is often referred to as a control center. Hormone \nsignals influence the equilibrium, stability, and homeostasis \nof the human body and regulate many specific metabolic \nfunctions. Children need a healthy endocrine system to \nmaintain the expected growth and development pattern and \nensure appropriate organ and tissue function (Figure 15-5).\nThe target cells\u2019 ability to respond to the associated \nhormone depends on the presence and adequacy of cel\u00ad\nlular membrane receptors that bind with the hormone \nsubstance. Receptors are considered dynamic, as they can \nchange and adapt to the needs of the cells; they respond \nto high levels or low levels of secreted hormones. Cellular \nmembrane receptors react to the chemical messenger \n\u00adhormones, while the liver degrades hormones and the \nkidneys secrete hormones as needed to ensure precise \nregulation of the body\u2019s functions.\nThe stimulation of an endocrine gland that leads to its \nrelease of a hormone depends on the gland\u2019s activation by \nan appropriate message.

Most often, it is \ncaused by a tumor in the pituitary, which stimulates production of the precursor to cortisol, or in the adrenal gland itself. In the \npresence of excess cortisol, a child experiences decreased lineal growth, development of obesity, very poor wound healing, \necchymosis, osteoporosis, weakness, poor glucose tolerance, and muscle atrophy. Medical treatment includes either drugs that \ninhibit cortisol production or removal of the tumor if one is present and operable.\nAddison Syndrome\nAddison syndrome is caused by reduced production and secretion of the hormones of the adrenal gland. Reduced levels of \ncortisol (a steroid hormone that regulates blood glucose and suppresses inflammatory responses) and aldosterone (a steroid \nhormone that controls and manages potassium and sodium) lead to poor stress responses, poor healing, severe abdominal \npain, hypotension, kidney failure, and shock. Some children feel better and respond within 1 to 2 days of drug therapy.\nGraves\u2019s Disease (Thyrotoxicosis)\nMostly found in adolescent females, Graves\u2019s disease is an immune-mediated disorder associated with hyperthyroidism and \ncaused by stimulated B-lymphocyte immunoglobulins that bind to the thyroid hormone\u2013releasing receptors, mimicking the \naction of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Increased production and release of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 cause the \nchild to have an enlarged thyroid, increased heart rate and blood pressure, widened pulse pressure, palpitations, nervousness, \nirritability, tremors, diarrhea, heat intolerance, profound perspiration, weight loss, exophthalmoses (protrusion of the eyes within \nthe eye sockets, also known as Graves\u2019s ophthalmopathy), and poor sleep quality. Medical management includes drugs to \nsuppress thyrotropic levels and decrease thyroid hormone secretion of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Surgical \nresection of the enlarged thyroid and beta blockers for cardiac consequences may be required as well (Bauer, 2016; Levitsky & \nSinha, 2013).\nThyroid Storm\nA rare phenomenon in which a child\u2019s thyroid produces dangerously large quantities of thyroid hormone, leading to high fever \nwith dehydration, severe tachycardia, diarrhea, shock, and death if not disrupted.

With the international intro\u00ad\nduction of iodized salt, the \u201cgoiter belt\u201d no longer exists, but \na trend toward selling non-iodized salt products and a con\u00ad\ncern about the health effects of excessive dietary sodium \nmay contribute to current increases in iodine deficiency, \nparticularly in pregnant women (Pearce, 2015). Low levels \nof maternal dietary iodine during fetal development can \nlead to developmental delays and hearing and speech defi\u00ad\ncits in children. In response to low levels of iodine, a child \nwill develop a goiter\u2014an enlargement of the thyroid gland \nthat represents an attempt by this gland to expand its size \nso as to produce more thyroid hormones.\nRapid diagnosis of iodine deficiency is made by measur\u00ad\ning urinary iodine concentrations. Levels less than 50 mcg/L \nare considered positive. In geographic areas known to have \nlow iodine, it is recommended that a pregnant or lactating \nmother take at least 150 mcg/L of iodine as a daily supplement, \ninfants and children need 90 mcg/L, and children older than 9 \nyears need 120 mcg/L (American Thyroid Association, 2016).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nPrecocious Puberty\nConsidered a type of a growth disorder, precocious puberty \nis an abnormal, premature onset of puberty. Its etiology may \nbe environmental, hormonal, or genetic. This disorder is caused \nby an excess secretion of sex hormones, with the onset of the \ndisorder (development of secondary sexual characteristics) \noccurring before the ages of 6 to 7 years in females and 10 \nyears in boys. Management includes gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone therapy (Gn-RH analogue) to turn off the excess \npituitary secretion or topical steroids. Monthly injections of \nleuprolide (Lupron Depot) through the expected age of pu\u00ad\nberty are commonly given to delay any further development \nof puberty (Mayo Clinic, 2014).\n\t\nDiabetes Mellitus\t\n203\n", " UNIQUE FOR KIDS\nType 1 Diabetes Mellitus\nType 1 diabetes is associated with younger age, genetic \npredisposition to autoimmunity, and environmental factors \n(such as infection) that produce an autoimmune attack on \nthe beta cells, leading to their destruction. Owing to the \ndecrease in the insulin-producing beta cells, other cells in \nthe body are unable to obtain adequate glucose for energy, \nand the starvation response of fatty acid breakdown begins \nas the body seeks an alternative source of energy. Breakdown \nof fatty acids produces ketone bodies as a by-product, and \nthese begin to accumulate in the blood along with glucose. \nThe presence of these ketone bodies puts the child in an \nacidotic state.\nChildren with type 1 diabetes can present with polyuria, \npolydipsia, polyphagia, weakness, flushed or dry skin, changes \nin visual acuity, mental slowness and confusion, and weight \nloss (thin appearance). They may also demonstrate poor \nwound healing, yeast infections, dehydration, and hypotension. \nLaboratory analysis will show high serum blood glucose levels, \nlow specific gravity with diuresis or high specific gravity with \nsevere dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, ketones in the \nMedical Management of Type 1 Diabetes\nThe entire pediatric healthcare team should be involved \nwith the medical management of a child with diabetes and \nthe family, parents, and caregivers. A pediatric endocri\u00ad\nnologist, Child Life specialist, social worker, nutritionist, \nchild psychologist, pharmacist, primary care medical staff, \nCertified Diabetic Nurse Educator, and pediatric nursing \nstaff can all contribute to the establishment of a manage\u00ad\nment team. The child\u2019s school must be notified, and the \nclinicians should work with the family to create a medical \nmanagement plan (identified as a \u201c504 Plan\u201d under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act) to establish a strong \nrelationship with the school nurse or other staff members \nto cover any issues related to blood glucose checking and \ninsulin administration during school hours. Teachers should \nbe taught the symptoms of hypoglycemia and know how \nto call for help if the child becomes symptomatic during \nclassroom time. The successful care of a child with type 1 \ndiabetes truly takes a village.\nIt is imperative to assist the family in managing a child\u2019s \ndiabetes so that as the child grows into young adulthood \nand adulthood, there is a lesser chance of the development \nof severe complications of the disease. Heart disease, blind\u00ad\nness, stroke, kidney failure, and nontraumatic lower-limb \namputations are all consequences of diabetes in later years \n(National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and \nHealth Promotion, 2011).\nInitially, medical management begins with the stabiliza\u00ad\ntion of a child who often presents to the healthcare arena in \nthe two. With type 2 diabetes, children can present with \nnormal weight or obesity, but the symptom set of weight \nloss, polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia and so forth is similar \nto that seen in children with type 1 diabetes. Distinguishing \nthe two types generally depends on family history: Most \nchildren who develop type 2 diabetes have a strong family \nhistory of the disease, whereas those who develop type 1 \nfrequently do not.\nType 1 diabetes is associated with lifelong dependency \non self-administered insulin therapy, while type 2 diabetes \nrequires dietary modification, lifestyle modification, weight \nmanagement, and sometimes the addition of oral antihy\u00ad\nperglycemic medications. Approximately 1 in 600 children \n(1.93 per 1000) present with type 1 diabetes in the United \nStates with a 21.1% increase over an 8 year time period \n(Dabelea et\u00a0al., 2014). The average age of diagnosis of type \n2 diabetes in children is 10 to 14 years, whereas children \ntend to be younger when they are diagnosed with type 1 \ndisease. Sometimes, children whose type 2 diabetes was \ninitially well controlled via oral medication can progress \nto needing insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes incidence is \nincreasing in the United States as well as worldwide. Between \n20\u201350% of new cases of diabetes in children are new-onset \ntype 1 (Dabelea et\u00a0al., 2014). Diagnosis of diabetes can be \nconfirmed through three tests: abnormal results of fasting \nor random plasma glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c levels, \nor an oral glucose tolerance test (Laffel & Svoren, 2011).\nurine, elevated triglycerides, osmotic diuresis and glycosuria, \nand elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Suboptimal vitamin \nD values are a common finding as well, although their contri\u00ad\nbution to the development of the disorder is as yet unclear.\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus\nTypically associated with older age and history of exposure \nto gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes is becoming more \ncommon in children. In this endocrine disorder, insulin is \nproduced in the child\u2019s pancreas, but the body does not use \nit properly (insulin resistance). People of certain races and \nethnicities are at increased risk for type 2 disease, including \nNative Americans, African Americans, Latinos, and Hispanic \nAmericans. Factors associated with a diagnosis of type 2 \ndiabetes in children include family history, physical inactivity, \noverweight or obesity, prediabetes, gestational diabetes, race, \nhypertension, abnormal cholesterol lab values, and a history \nof hyperglycemia (American Diabetes Association, 2016).\n204\t\nChapter 15\u2003 Metabolism\n", "over the course of the entire day. To ensure a constant rate \nof insulin infusion over a 24-hour period, which provides \na \u201cbasal\u201d rate of delivery, many children wear an insulin \npump around the clock; this device administers rapid-acting \ninsulin based on a complex set of calculations that take \ninto account the child\u2019s daily insulin needs (usually based \non weight), fluctuations in measured blood glucose levels, \nand carbohydrate intake, with the last being calculated for \nmeal-specific dosing by the pump\u2019s internal computer. Even \nyoung children (early school age) can successfully manage \ntheir glucose with insulin pumps.\nEvery 3 to 6 months, the child\u2019s serum hemoglobin A1c \n(HbA1c) level should be checked to reassess the insulin regi\u00ad\nmen and troubleshoot changes in the child\u2019s needs. HbA1c \nlevels are an assessment of the percentage of hemoglobin \nthat is glycosylated\u2014that is, has a glucose molecule attached \nto it\u2014which gives an average value of blood glucose over \nthe preceding 3 months (90 days). Higher levels of HbA1c \nare associated with microvascular and macrovascular com\u00ad\nplications. In a nondiabetic adult, one would expect this \nvalue to be between 5% and 6%; in diabetic children, ideal \nranges are 7.5% to 8.5% for children younger than 6 years, \nless than 8% for children between 6 and 12 years of age, \nand less than 7.5% for children between 13 and 18 years \nof age. HbA1c values consistently above the child\u2019s average \nfor age in consecutive tests indicate a need for clinicians to \nidentify factors contributing to hyperglycemia, including \npoor adherence to carbohydrate counting, blood glucose \ntesting (Figure 15-8), and insulin administration; however, \na transient uptick in HbA1c in a child previously within aver\u00ad\nage range could simply indicate a growth spurt or stress, as \ngrowth and stress hormones contribute to insulin resistance.\nAnnual screening for autoimmune thyroid disease and \nceliac disease are also recommended for children with \ntype 1 diabetes, as these disorders are more common in \npeople with type 1 diabetes than in the general population \n(Glastras et\u00a0al., 2005).\ndiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening condition \ncharacterized by high blood glucose levels, dehydration, \nelectrolyte imbalance, and metabolic acidosis.

The \ninsulin drip is started slowly, with frequent reassessments of \nthe child\u2019s blood sugar. The goal is to reduce the child\u2019s blood \nglucose levels by 50 mg/dL per hour. A rate any faster can cause \nhypoglycemia, and a rate any slower limits the inhibition of \nketogenesis and continues to expose the child\u2019s physiology \nto damaging levels of high blood glucose.\nThe pediatric nurse must double-check the insulin drip \ninfusion bag and pump setup with a second nurse, and check \nevery dosage change on the IV pump with a second nurse. \nMedication errors associated with IV insulin drip infusions \ncan be life-threatening.\n206\t\nChapter 15\u2003 Metabolism\n", "guidelines should be repeated.

The cleansing mecha\u00ad\nnism of the nasal cilia plays an essential role in maintaining \nthese airways. The lower airway passageways include the \nmain bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Also essential to \nthe respiratory system is the thoracic musculature, which \nprovides for inhalation and exhalation. Red blood cells carry \noxygen molecules produced by ventilation and distribute \nthem to the tissues of the body.\nVentilation refers to the process of breathing air into \nand out of the lungs with the support of the following \nstructures (Figure 16-2):\n\u2022\t Intercostal muscles, ribs and diaphragm: Structures \nthat provide support in chest expansion, contrac\u00ad\ntion, and flow of air into the lungs.\n\u2022\t Chemoreceptors: Sensors that respond to a change \nin the blood oxygen saturation (the percentage of \nred blood cells with attached oxygen molecules) by \nsending a chemical message to the brain stem. This \nprocess stimulates the child to increase the respira\u00ad\ntory rate and depth. High levels of carbon dioxide \nalso stimulate the child\u2019s ventilation.\n\u2022\t Respiratory centers in the medulla: In these cen\u00ad\nters, the child\u2019s increased rate or decreased rate of \nrespirations is regulated by nerves that send signals \nbased on oxygenation needs.\nA child\u2019s respiratory system has several anatomic and \nphysiological differences relative to the respiratory system of \nan adult. These differences, such as a smaller, narrower airway, \ncan contribute to the development of adverse respiratory \nconditions. They also affect the assessment and manage\u00ad\nment of an infant or child who presents with a respiratory \ninfection, condition, or compromised state of ventilation.\nRespiratory System Differences in Newborns\n\u2022\t Newborns and young infants have a prominent \nocciput, larger tongue, larger tonsils, shorter and \nnarrower trachea, large and floppy epiglottis, and \ncompliant chest wall, all of which increase the risk \nof respiratory compromise.\n\u2022\t The newborn has an approximate airway size of \n4 to 5 mm, compared to the adult airway size of \n18 to 20 mm. The infant\u2019s airway is also narrower \nand shorter than that of an adult at the larynx. The \nnewborn\u2019s and infant\u2019s airway has the approximate \ndiameter of the child\u2019s little finger.\n\u2022\t The newborn\u2019s lungs have fewer alveoli than \nthe lungs of an older child. A newborn has \n\u00adapproximately 20 to 50 million alveoli, whereas \nIntroduction\nThe pediatric respiratory system is one of the most important \nsystems to understand. Respiratory illnesses, infections, \nand conditions are common reasons why families seek \npediatric health care, and are common causes of illness \nthroughout childhood. Children may present with acute, \nchronic, or life-threatening respiratory conditions, all of \nwhich can affect the stability of the child\u2019s well-being and \nhis or her quality of life. Especially vulnerable populations \nin terms of respiratory disorders are premature infants, \nimmunocompromised children, and children with a \nchronic illness.\nThe concepts of gas exchange and oxygenation in the \npediatric population begin at the initiation of extra-uterine \nrespiration and continue throughout the entire develop\u00ad\nmental period of childhood. The most vulnerable period \nfor the newborn is the first 24 hours of life. During this \nperiod, the neonate must clear amniotic fluid, initiate a \nbreathing pattern, and maintain effective gas exchange \nwith the intake of oxygen (which moves from the lungs \ninto the bloodstream) and the exhalation of carbon dioxide \n(when moves from the bloodstream into the lungs). Once \nwell established, the infant\u2019s respiratory system develops \nrapidly. The premature newborn has relatively fewer \nalveoli, reduced quantities of surfactant, and, therefore, \nmore challenges in effective oxygenation (the addition \nof oxygen to the body\u2019s systems). Figure 16-1 illustrates a \nchild\u2019s respiratory tract and structures.\nFigure 16-1\u2002 A child\u2019s respiratory tract and structures. \nPharynx\nEpiglottis\nLungs\nOral cavity\nNasal cavity\nLarynx\nTrachea\n212\t\nChapter 16\u2003 Gas Exchange and\u00a0Oxygenation\n", "Figure 16-2\u2002 The ventilation process. \nInhalation\nExhalation\nMedulla\nChemoreceptors\nAir inhaled\nRib cage gets\nsmaller as\nmuscles relax\nRib cage expands\nas neck and chest\nmuscles contract\nLung\nAir exhaled\nDiaphragm\nlowers\n(contracts)\nDiaphragm\nat rest\n(relaxes)\nCerebellum\nCheyne-Stokes breathing\napnea\nhyperpnea\nBrain stem\nCentral neurogenic\nhyperventilation\nBiot respiration\nApneustic respiration\nAtaxic respiration\nAgonal gasps\nNormal breathing\nExhalation\nInhalation\nExternal\nintercostal\nmuscles\ncontract\nInternal\nintercostal\nmuscles\ncontract\nan 8-year-old child has approximately 300 million \n\u00adalveoli. Newborns also have a faster respiratory rate \nand an uneven respiratory pattern.\n\u2022\t The newborn and the infant rely primarily on their \ndiaphragm and abdominal muscles for breathing. \nIntercostal muscles are immature and in this devel\u00ad\nopmental stage support only the small chest wall.\n\u2022\t Newborns and young infants have decreased pro\u00ad\nduction of mucus, which acts as a cleansing agent \nto move irritants, particles, and microbes out of the \npulmonary system.\n\u2022\t Because of the risk of sudden infant death syn\u00ad\ndrome (SIDS), newborns and young infants \nshould always be placed on their back to sleep, \nshould never participate in co-sleeping with an \nadult, and should not have excessive blankets or a \nbody-molding mattress that might trap expired air \nor compromise air exchange.\n\u2022\t Due to the child\u2019s large occiput, the newborn \nshould be placed in a sniffing position for maxi\u00ad\nmal air exchange when the ventilation process is \ncompromised.\n\t\nRespiratory System Function\t\n213\n", "The major concern for the pediatric nurse working in a \nclinical setting is the rapid identification, assessment, and \nmanagement of a child with a respiratory pathology. It is \nnot uncommon to encounter children seeking nursing and \nmedical care for treatment of symptoms and complica\u00ad\ntions associated with a variety of pulmonary conditions. \nWe next discuss common oxygenation and gas exchange \ndisorders, including respiratory distress, asthma, cystic \nfibrosis, and bronchiolitis.\nRespiratory Distress\nInsufficient intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide \n(CO2) can cause a child to experience hypoxemia; low levels \nof oxygen in the blood can rapidly develop into hypoxia. \nHypoxia is a general term used to describe low levels of \noxygen in body tissue. Hypoxemia is a low level of oxygen \nin the arterial blood, which is assessed by measuring the \npartial pressure of oxygen (PaO2).\nRisk Factors for Respiratory Distress\nRespiratory distress in children, particularly newborns and \nyoung children, requires rapid recognition and intervention. \nYoung children, in general, experience rapid decompensa\u00ad\ntion of the respiratory system when acute illness is present. \nRisk factors associated with respiratory distress include an \nacute episode of airway obstruction, especially in light of \nchildren\u2019s narrower airways and their decreased respiratory \nreserves, and inadequate compensatory mechanisms. Several \nacute conditions can cause children to have a higher risk \nfor respiratory distress\u2014for example, infant respiratory \ndistress syndrome (previously called hyaline membrane \ndisease), tension pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism \nor trauma, and viral or bacterial infection causing inflam\u00ad\nmation. Chronic pulmonary conditions such as cystic \nfibrosis, asthma, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia also \nplace children at higher risk for rapid respiratory distress \nwhen they experience an acute exacerbation of their illness.\n\t Respiratory System Differences in Infants and \nChildren\n\u2022\t A child will experience much louder adventitious \nbreath sounds than an adult in the presence of \n\u00adpathology or distress.\n\u2022\t The infant\u2019s and young child\u2019s eustachian tubes \nare\u00a0at a more horizontal position and are shorter \nthan these structures in adults, leaving the child \nmore prone to fluid retention and middle ear \ninfections.\n\u2022\t The infant is an obligate nose breather and requires \nsuctioning to maintain a patent airway in the pres\u00ad\nence of copious and thick secretions.\nAssessments of the Respiratory \nSystem\nOne of the most important aspects of pediatric nurs\u00ad\ning across multiple clinical settings is the ability to \nconfidently and thoroughly assess a child\u2019s respiratory \nsystem. Assessments must include a visual observation \nfor air hunger, shortness of breathing, nasal flaring, use \nof accessory muscles, and head bobbing in the infant. \n\u00adAssessments also include auscultating all lung fields\u2014both \nthe upper and lower airways, and the anterior, posterior, \nand lateral areas\u2014very carefully for adventitious breath \nsounds (abnormal). Adventitious breath sounds include \nrales (popping, bubbling, or high-pitched crackling \nsounds), rhonchi (rattling breath sounds that resemble \nsnoring), wheezing, and stridor (high-pitched grating \nbreath sounds). The assessment should include alternate \nsides of the lung fields for comparison (Figure 16-3). \nFinally, assessments should include percussion and palpa\u00ad\ntion and respiration.\nFigure 16-3\u2002 Auscultating a child\u2019s lungs. \n\u00a9 Image Point Fr/Shutterstock\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nRespiratory Compromise\n\u2022\t Respiratory illnesses are more potentially dangerous \nin younger children than in teens and adults.\n\u2022\t Infants and young children can progress rapidly from \nrespiratory distress to respiratory failure to a code blue.\n\u2022\t Newborns, infants, and young children often present \nwith dehydration when they have a respiratory issue, \nas tachypnea, shortness of breath, and respiratory \ndistress often result in a significant decrease of oral \nfluid intake.\n214\t\nChapter 16\u2003 Gas Exchange and\u00a0Oxygenation\n", "delivery devices, suctioning, bronchodilators, steroidal \nanti-inflammatory medications, and fluids. Children with \nmild distress should not be discharged from a clinic or \nacute care environment until stable and until the pediatric \nteam deems the child safe enough not to have symptom \nexacerbation. In contrast, severe respiratory distress re\u00ad\nquires a team approach to airway management, including \nrapid-sequence intubation, ventilation, and possibly rapid \ntransport to a higher level of care.\nNursing Care for Respiratory Distress\nNursing care will primarily focus on the early identification \nand stabilization of the child\u2019s compromised airway and \ngas exchange. The nurse will be a key team member in the \nrapid response to assist the child with respiratory distress, \nand should be in a primary position in terms of ensuring \ncommunication between team members. This practitioner \nwill assist in the coordination of airway management, \noxygen delivery, positioning, specimen collection, and \nmedication management. The nurse should never leave \nthe bedside of the child, but rather assist in coordinating \nthe efforts undertaken during a team response.\nOnce the child is stable, the nurse works holistically to \nsupport the child\u2019s emotional state and alleviate the family\u2019s \nanxiety. The family will be very fearful and worried about \nthe child\u2019s clinical presentation and status. Knowing that \nthe team is assisting the child will be important, and the \nnurse can help educate the family on the steps being taken \nand the rationale for the airway management interventions.\nAssessments for Respiratory Distress\nAssessments for respiratory distress should begin with visual \nobservation of the child\u2019s overall appearance and behavior. \nWork of breathing must be assessed, and the nurse must \nensure the child has a patent airway. Level of conscious\u00ad\nness, positioning, overall distress, interactive behaviors, \nand skin color should be determined. The nurse should \nhave access to the child\u2019s current weight to prepare for the \nadministration of emergency medications. Oxygen satura\u00ad\ntions, arterial blood gases, chest radiography, and end-tidal \ncarbon dioxide measurements should all be performed to \ndetermine the severity of the child\u2019s condition.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nP\nertinent findings when a child is in distress include the \nresults of the following assessments:\n\u2022\t Restlessness, apprehension, fussiness, and \ninconsolability\n\u2022\t Decreased level of consciousness with ineffective \nventilation and poor gas exchange\n\u2022\t Nasal flaring and grunting\n\u2022\t Circumoral pallor to circumoral cyanosis (bluish dis\u00ad\ncoloration of the skin due to low oxygen saturation)\n\u2022\t Respiratory rate and rhythm\n\u2022\t Increased use of accessory muscles, including head \nbobbing in infants (severe sign)\n\u2022\t Loud adventitious breath sounds (wheezing, rales, \ncrackles), or in severe cases, diminished breath sounds\n\u2022\t Cough\n\u2022\t Increased substernal, sternal, supraclavicular, intercos\u00ad\ntal, and subcostal retractions (pulling of the muscles \nbetween the ribs inward during breathing)\n\u2022\t Central or peripheral cyanosis, including cyanosis of \nthe nipples, lips, and nail beds\n\u2022\t Perfusion as assessed through capillary refill time \n(CRT) and pulses\n\u2022\t Dehydration, turgor, urine output, and the ability to \nswallow and take oral fluids\nDepending on the underlying etiology of the child\u2019s re\u00ad\nspiratory distress, it is not uncommon for children with acute \nairway infections and inflammations to experience relapses of \ncritical symptoms. The nurse must closely monitor the child\u2019s \ncondition and immediately report any change of status to the \npediatric healthcare team.\nMedical Treatment for Respiratory Distress\nMild respiratory distress differs from severe distress in \nterms of its medical management and treatment. Mild re\u00ad\nspiratory distress can be managed with positioning, oxygen \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nM\nany parents will want to know how long their child\u2019s \n\u00adrespiratory infection symptoms will last. Estimates offered \nby health authorities in the United States, such as the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH), often conflict on that point because \nthey are not evidence based. One research group sought to \nrectify this omission by conducting a review of the literature. \nThe review included 23 randomized controlled trials and 25 \nobservational studies. In looking at data on the expected \nlength of symptoms for the most common respiratory tract \ninfections\u2014earache, sore throat, cough, and nonspecific cold \nsymptoms\u2014the researchers determined that the CDC\u2019s and \nNIH\u2019s current estimates of symptom duration closely matched \n(or were slightly longer than) the time frames in the reviewed \nstudies, with the exception of two specific symptoms:\n\u2022\t Earache, which often lasts 7 to 8 days, in contrast to \nthe 4-day estimate offered by the CDC\n(continues)\n\t\nRespiratory Distress\t\n215\n", "RESEARCH EVIDENCE\u2002 (continued)\n\u2022\t Acute cough, which frequently resolves in about \n10\u00a0days, a much shorter time frame than the 21 days \nstated by the NIH\nData from Thompson, M., Vodicka, T.

Children age 6 months through 8 years who \nare being vaccinated for influenza for the first time, as well as \nchildren who have previously received only one dose of vac\u00ad\ncine, should get two doses of vaccine in the current season, \nwith the first dose given as soon as the season\u2019s vaccine is \navailable. Children who present with fever of unknown origin, \nhave respiratory symptoms, have had a known exposure, or \nhave recently been hospitalized should be tested for the \ninfluenza virus by nasal aspirates and swabs.\nThinking in Concepts to Promote \nSafety: Respiratory Emergencies\nIt is imperative that the pediatric nurse have equipment \nclose at hand that will assist the team in securing a patent \nairway, provide support for ventilation and oxygenation, \nand control the child\u2019s symptoms of respiratory distress. \nThe following essential equipment should be readily avail\u00ad\nable in all clinical settings:\n\u2022\t Emergency ventilation equipment: Masks of \nvarious sizes and self-filling resuscitation bags \n(Ambu bags) (Figure 16-4)\n\u2022\t A source of oxygen (wall source or tanks) with the \ncorrect \u201cChristmas tree\u201d\u2013style valve that fits the \noxygen tubing (Figure 16-5)\n\u2022\t Suction equipment, including a variety of suction \ntip devices such as olive tip, tonsil tip, bulb syringe, \nand deep sterile suctioning kits (Figure 16-6)\n\u2022\t Crash cart (Figure 16-7) with intubation \nequipment; tracheostomy equipment; rescue \nmedications such as racemic epinephrine, \nepinephrine 1:1000 and 1:10,000, albuterol, sodium \nFigure 16-4\u2002 Two sizes (adult and child) of bag-valve mask devices \nfor emergency ventilation. \n\u00a9 Terayut Janjaranuphab/Shutterstock\nFigure 16-5\u2002 \u201cChristmas tree\u201d\u2013style valve for oxygen tubing.\n\u00a9 Narumon Numpha/Shutterstock\nFigure 16-6\u2002 Suction tip devices: (A) olive tip; (B) tonsil tip; (C) bulb \nsyringe. \nbicarbonate, and EpiPen (ACLS Training Center, \n2015); and a length-based color-coded resuscitation \ntape (such as a Broselow tape [Figure 16-8]) for \nrapid determination of emergency medications and \nequipment for various groupings of weights\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\n216\t\nChapter 16\u2003 Gas Exchange and\u00a0Oxygenation\n", "Figure 16-7\u2002 All clinical settings should have (A) a crash cart readily available with (B) intubation equipment, (C) tracheostomy equipment, \nand (D) rescue medications.\n(A) \u00a9 Jones & Bartlett Learning.

National certification as a pediatric advanced life sup\u00ad\nport nurse signifies competency in responding to a child in \nsevere distress or who has suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest. \nContinued practice through mock codes helps to keep a team \nof responders ready for a child with advanced needs. Nurses \nneed to be able to confidently respond to a child in distress \nby taking the following steps:\n\u2022\t Rapidly identifying the symptoms of distress and tak\u00ad\ning immediate action\n\u2022\t Positioning the child in a high Fowler\u2019s position, initi\u00ad\nating suctioning, and delivering oxygen therapy\n\u2022\t Requesting team help immediately by calling the \nrapid response team (RRT) or code team as needed, \nand supporting the application of the American Heart \nAssociation\u2019s Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) or \nPediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) program as\u00ad\nsessment, skills, and algorithms as warranted\n\u2022\t Applying principles of infection control until the \nsource of respiratory distress is identified\n\u2022\t Assembling emergency response equipment and \nmedications\n\u2022\t Providing support and education for the family\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nPrevention of Airway Occlusion with Epiglottitis\nEpiglottitis is a severe, life-threatening infection of the epi\u00ad\nglottis (the small structure that closes the trachea off while \nswallowing) caused mainly by Haemophilus influenzae type \nB bacteria. The child\u2019s epiglottis swells above the vocal cords, \ncausing severe narrowing and potential complete occlusion of \nthe airway. Many children in the United States are vaccinated \nfor H. influenzae starting at 2 months of age, but some are \nnot. If a child presents with the abrupt classic \u201cDs\u201d (drooling, \ndistress, dystonia, dysphagia), is tripoding (Figure 16-9), and \nappears toxic, epiglottitis should be assumed and emergency \nairway management with possible tracheostomy should be \nundertaken. Rapid administration of intravenous antibiotics \nis essential. \nFigure 16-9\u2002 A child tripoding.\n\u00a9 Jones & Bartlett Learning. Photographed by Glen E. Ellman.\nBEST PRACTICES\nRespiratory Distress\nA child who presents with respiratory distress needs a team \napproach to assess, manage, and stabilize the airway. For rapid \nhelp, the pediatric nurse should initiate the protocol for the \nRRT, or if the child is progressing from respiratory distress to \nrespiratory failure, the code team should be called to prevent \na full cardiopulmonary arrest.\nAsthma\nAsthma is considered a chronic inflammatory disease \nof the lungs that affects the small and large airways. Its \npathophysiology is thought to stem from the airways\u2019 \nhyper-responsiveness to specific triggers\u2014which can include \nanything from allergens to cold air to stress to exercise\u2014to \nwhich the child is exposed. Asthma has a strong genetic \n218\t\nChapter 16\u2003 Gas Exchange and\u00a0Oxygenation\n", "component and may be associated with atopy; eczema, \nasthma, and rhinitis often go together. When an infant or \nyoung toddler first presents with a hyper-responsive airway \nleading to wheezing and cough, the primary diagnosis \nmay be reactive airway disease (RAD). A second episode \nis then considered diagnostic for asthma.\nThe incidence of asthma is very high. Approximately 9.3% \nof all children have a confirmed diagnosis of asthma (the total \nU.S. prevalence is now 6.8 million children) with 50% of new \ncases occurring in the child\u2019s first year of life, followed by \n80% occurring by the fifth year of life (CDC, 2015). Asthma \ndeaths are preventable but on the rise: Mortality from this \ncause is increasing by 6% per year, with 3630 deaths from \nasthma occurring annually (CDC, 2015). School absences \ndue to asthma are significant, with the number of annual \nasthma-related school absences of children age 0 to 17 rang\u00ad\ning from 9020 to 703,570 depending on the state (Khavjou, \nNurmagambetov, Murphy, & Orenstein, 2016). Nationally, \nchildren age 5 to 17 collectively missed 10.5 million days of \nschool in 2008 due to asthma exacerbations (CDC, 2013).\nThe pathology of asthma is typically an inflammatory \nhypersensitivity response to an external substance or ex\u00ad\nposure (\u201ctrigger\u201d) that starts a response cascade. First there \nis an immediate hypersensitivity in the bronchial mucosa, \nwith immunoglobulin E (IgE) molecules becoming attached \nto basophils and mast cells. Chemical mediators are then \nreleased from these cells, causing a significant series of \nclinical symptoms:\n\u2022\t Bronchial constriction of the smooth muscles sur\u00ad\nrounding the outer aspects of the large and small \nairways\n\u2022\t Copious mucus production by the mucus-producing \ncells lining the airways\n\u2022\t Inflammation that causes edema and narrowing of \nthe inner luminal tracheobronchial mucosa\nInternal stimuli have also been known to cause asthma. \nFor example, extreme emotional responses may produce \nasthma symptoms.\nWith continuation of symptoms and the development \nof severe edema, mucus production, and bronchial con\u00ad\nstriction, the child may develop serious bronchospasms. \nIf the hyper-responsiveness is not stopped, the child may \nsuffer insufficient oxygenation, CO2 air trapping, lung \nhyper-inflammation, severe respiratory distress, and com\u00ad\nplete obstruction. Asthma deaths can be prevented by rapid \nresponses to a child\u2019s early symptoms of an asthma attack.\nDiagnosis of Asthma\nThe diagnostic process for asthma includes a health history, \nfamily history of asthma, history of recent viral infections, \nand identification of symptoms\u2014adventitious breath sounds \nsuch as wheezing, coughing, mucus production, and airway \nhyper-responsiveness. A complete blood cell count may be \nordered to assess for infection, and nasal secretions may \nbe assessed for the presence of viruses such as respiratory \nsyncytial virus (RSV), a pathogen that causes mild, flu-like \nsymptoms in most people.\nRisk Factors for Asthma\nRisk factors associated with asthma include family history \nof asthma. Risk factors for reactive airway disease include \nexposure to respiratory infections, cigarette smoke, aller\u00ad\ngens, and other triggers. Family members must be helped \nto identify the child\u2019s triggers so as to prevent repeated \nexposures and subsequent episodes of asthma.\nAsthma at School: Teachers\u2019 and Administrators\u2019 \nEducational Guidelines\nBecause of the amount of time children spend at school, \nand their chances of being exposed to triggers there, an \nasthma exacerbation starting at school is not uncommon. \nIt is imperative that parents disclose their child\u2019s diagnosis \nof asthma to school personnel and provide a list of trig\u00ad\ngers. It is important to have ready access to rapid-acting \nbronchodilators in the school environment. Many state \nlaws now encourage children to carry their rapid-acting \ninhalers with them at all times.\nExpeditious identification of asthma symptoms and fast \nadministration of rapid-acting bronchodilator medications \ncan prevent serious asthma attacks at school. Teachers, \nadministrators, and parent volunteers should know what \nto look for in a child with a confirmed asthma diagnosis \nwho is having an asthma attack:\n\u2022\t Shortness of breath\n\u2022\t Persistent or frequently occurring cough\n\u2022\t Inability to speak in full sentences\n\u2022\t Wanting to sit out of exercise or play activities\n\u2022\t Wheezing\n\u2022\t Tachypnea (any respiratory rate of 60 breaths/min \nor faster requires immediate transfer to a medical \nfacility from school, without the delay of waiting \nfor a parent to pick a child up)\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nAsthma Triggers\nAvoiding exposure to asthma triggers can prevent asthma \nattacks and exacerbations. Triggers for asthma include the \nfollowing factors:\n\u2022\t Animal dander\n\u2022\t Grasses, pine trees, and other vegetation\n(continues)\n\t\nAsthma\t\n219\n", "FAMILY EDUCATION\u2002 (continued)\n\u2022\t Cockroach dust (dried remains)\n\u2022\t Dust mites\n\u2022\t Airway irritants such as paint fumes, aerosols, \nand\u00a0smoke\n\u2022\t Altitude\n\u2022\t Emotions and stress\n\u2022\t Mold and home allergens\n\u2022\t Fireplace and wood stove smoke\n\u2022\t Cigarette, pipe, e-cigarette, and cigar smoke and \nfumes\n\u2022\t Food allergies\n\u2022\t Cold air or a change in the weather\n\u2022\t Exercise\n\u2022\t Fragrances\n\u2022\t Gastrointestinal reflux\n\u2022\t Inhaled illegal drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, \nand\u00a0methamphetamines\nMedical Treatment for Asthma\nPrevention is the gold standard for treating asthma. Second \nto prevention is administration of rapid-acting broncho\u00ad\ndilators at the onset of asthma symptoms. (See the Phar\u00ad\nmacology feature for information on medications used to \ntreat asthma.) A child with moderate to severe asthma will \nalso require daily preventive medications to reduce edema, \nimmunoglobulin reactions, and exacerbations linked to \nchemical mediators such as leukotrienes, acetylcholine, \nhistamine, and prostaglandins.\nShort-Acting Asthma Medications\n\u2022\t Short-acting beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol)\n\u2022\t Intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., \nmethylprednisolone)*\n\u2022\t Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone)\u2020\n\u2022\t Anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium bromide)\n\u2022\t Epinephrine (racemic)*\nLong-Acting Asthma Medications\n\u2022\t Inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone propionate)\n\u2022\t Long-acting beta-2 agonists (e.g., formoterol fumarate)\n\u2022\t Anti-immunoglobulin E antibodies (anti-IgE) (e.g., \nomalizumab)\n\u2022\t Mast cell inhibitors (e.g., cromolyn)\n\u2022\t Leukotriene modifiers (LM) (e.g., montelukast sodium)\n\u2022\t Methylxanthines (e.g., theophylline)\n* Used primarily in the emergency department setting for treatment \nof acute exacerbations, not for daily control of symptoms.\n\u2020 Used primarily after emergency department treatment of an acute \nexacerbation as prophylaxis against relapse. Courses longer than \n5\u00a0days provide no additional benefit.\nData from Alangari, 2014; American Lung Association, 2009; Egbuonu \net al., 2014; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2014a.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nB\necause asthma is an inflammatory process, the medications \nused in this disease address different aspects of the exacer\u00ad\nbation process. Bronchodilators, usually inhaled beta agonists, \nare used when symptoms first occur; they \u201crescue\u201d respiration \nby opening the bronchi so air can pass through. If the patient\u2019s \nairway is too constricted to allow inhaled bronchodilating \nmedications to enter, IV or injected medications may be needed \nto interrupt the exacerbation. In clinical settings, rapid-acting \nanti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids and \nepinephrine are generally used for this purpose.\nLong-acting asthma medications are used as maintenance \ntherapy to reduce systemic inflammation and prevent recurrence \nof asthma symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are favored for \nuse in children, but clinicians should be aware that they may \nhave long-term impacts on growth. These medications may \nalso lead to problematic side effects such as hyperglycemia \nin children who have or are at risk for diabetes (Egbuonu, \nAntonio, & Edavalath, 2014).\nNursing Care for Asthma\nThe central focus of care for a child of any age experiencing \nasthma symptoms is airway assessment and management. \nPediatric nurses must be confident in assisting a child who \nis experiencing wheezing, coughing, and asthma symptoms. \nRapid assessment of the child\u2019s clinical status\u2014including \nrespiratory rate, severity of symptoms, need for transport \nto a higher level of care, and signs of hypoxemia and \n\u00adhypoxia\u2014is the priority.\nAfter assessment and stabilization, the central focus of \nnursing care is on educating the child and parents on the \navoidance of triggers and care at home and in school, as well \nas understanding the nature of asthma as a chronic\u2014rather \nthan acute\u2014condition that needs ongoing management. \nIdentifying and correcting mistakes in inhaler technique is \nimportant for ensuring medication adherence (Braido et\u00a0al., \n2016). Assessing the caregivers\u2019 or child\u2019s ability to correctly \nuse a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or aerochamber, conduct \na peak flow evaluation, and follow the personalized asthma \naction plan can be instrumental not only in reducing the \nneed to seek health care, but also in decreasing the child\u2019s \nchance of a poor outcome, including asthma-related death \n(Figure 16-10). Continuing follow-up to reassess asthma \nsymptoms and update the child\u2019s and family\u2019s knowledge \nevery 3 to 6 months is an important aspect of care, as the \nchild\u2019s asthma symptoms may improve or worsen over \ntime and require a change in regimen.\n220\t\nChapter 16\u2003 Gas Exchange and\u00a0Oxygenation\n", "Figure 16-10\u2002 A child using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or \naerochamber. \nFAMILY EDUCATION\nC\nhildren with asthma must have ready access to their \nrescue inhalers. While playing outside, participating in \nsports, and going on field trips, children with asthma can \nbecome symptomatic in a short period of time. Preventive \nuse of a short-acting bronchodilator when a known trigger, \nsuch as cold air or exercise, is likely to be encountered can \nlimit the risk of an acute episode. When preventing an at\u00ad\ntack is not possible, having readily available access to the \ninhaler can reduce the severity of a child\u2019s asthma attack \nand prevent a hospitalization. However, if a child is using \nhis or her rescue inhaler multiple times per week, parents \nshould be encouraged to contact their healthcare provider \nfor reassessment.\nData from National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute.

Typically administered in emergency departments, \nthis drug is effective in rapidly opening the airways when \nsteroid anti-inflammatory agents and short-acting beta-2 \nagonists have not been effective (Wiebe & Rowe, 2007). \nFollow institutional protocols carefully, as nurses may not \nbe allowed to administer this drug without the presence \nof a respiratory therapist, and because some children have \nshown a rapid relapse of respiratory distress after a period \nof time post administration.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nT\nhe administration of albuterol mixed in heliox (helium and \noxygen together) has been shown to reduce symptoms \nand improve oxygenation during asthma episodes (Rivera, \nKim, Steward, Minasyan, & Brown, 2006).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nAsthma Care at Home: Asthma Action Plans\nThe development and initiation of asthma action plans has \nbeen shown to improve identification of children\u2019s impend\u00ad\ning and actual asthma attacks, as well as reduce children\u2019s \nneed for health care for asthma symptoms. Asthma action \nplans are created through the family\u2019s collaboration with a \nteam consisting of the child\u2019s healthcare provider, respiratory \ntherapist, and nurse. The action plan guides parents to make \ndecisions based on a color-coding system using peak flow \nmeasurements.\n\u2022\t Green zone/safety zone: If a child\u2019s daily peak flow mea\u00ad\nsurement is within 80% to 100% of the normal (non-\nasthma) value (green zone), the child takes the regular \ndaily medication and goes to school or participates in \nall planned activities.\n\u2022\t Yellow zone/caution zone: If the child\u2019s daily peak flow \nmeasurement is between 50% and 80% of normal \n(yellow zone), then the individualized action plan \nwill guide the parents and child to slow down, take \nmedications as prescribed, drink fluids, and be aware \nof symptoms.\n\u2022\t Red zone/danger zone: If the child\u2019s daily peak flow \nmeasurement is at or less than 50% of normal (red \nzone), then the child needs to take the medications \nand immediately seek professional medical treat\u00ad\nment. If rapid transportation is difficult or impossible, \nthe family should not use public transportation but \nshould be instructed to call 911.\n\u2022\t The National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Heart, \nLung, and Blood Institute (U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, 2015) provides a copy of the \ncolor-coded asthma action plan on its website, \nunder the Lung Diseases/Asthma Publications/Fact \nSheets tab.\nCystic Fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic dis\u00ad\norder caused by a mutation in the protein cystic fibrosis \ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene \non chromosome 7, which regulates digestive secretions, \nsweat, and mucus production. Cystic fibrosis causes cysts \n\t\nCystic Fibrosis\t\n221\n", "a genetic predisposition to the disease. The probability of \nhaving cystic fibrosis is 25% if both parents are carriers \nof the gene, and 50% that the child will be a carrier. Most \nchildren are diagnosed by 2 years of age (Cystic Fibrosis \nFoundation, 2015).\nMedical Treatment for Cystic Fibrosis\nTreatment focuses on the removal of tenacious mucus, \nprevention of pulmonary complications and infections, and \nthe restoration of nutritional balance. Antibiotics; mucolytic \nagents; mist inhalation; chest physiotherapy; postural drainage; \nvitamin A, D, E, and K and pancreatic enzyme replacements; \nand high-calorie diets are mainstays of CF treatment. Use \nof flutter devices and, in adolescents, high-frequency chest \nwall oscillation (known as the Vest; Figure 16-11) to help \ndislodge and clear mucus is essential. Intermittent positive-\npressure breathing therapy can be effective in improving \npulmonary function. In severe cases in which scarring and \ndysfunction have occurred, lung transplantation or heart\u2013lung \ntransplantation (unilateral or bilateral) may be required for \nlong-term survival.\nNursing Care for Cystic Fibrosis\nFamily education is the most important aspect of nursing \ncare of a child with cystic fibrosis. The family will be car\u00ad\ning for the child and his or her chronic disorder at home. \nTeaching and reinforcing meticulous care through home \nchest physiotherapy, secretion drainage, adequate nutrition \nwith a high-calorie and high-fat diet, medication adher\u00ad\nence, and knowing when to seek medical assistance for \nrespiratory conditions is paramount.\nand scarring within the pancreas, preventing the normal \nsecretion of digestive enzymes and insulin. In addition, \nexcessive sodium absorption in the lungs causes the nor\u00ad\nmally quite thin respiratory mucus secretions to become \nthicker, to the point that they obstruct the functioning of \nexocrine glands.\nThe potentially fatal combination of blocked exocrine \ngland secretion and viscous mucus production affects many \nbody systems, including the gastrointestinal, pancreatic, \npulmonary, and reproductive system. The problems are \ncaused by the absence of a transmembrane regulator en\u00ad\nzyme, which allows the flow of sodium and water into the \nmucus-producing cells, leading to viscous mucus. Chronic \nsecretion of this thick mucus (\u201ctenacious mucus\u201d) blocks the \nexocrine glands and leads to severe obstruction. The pres\u00ad\nence of the tenacious mucus also leaves the child vulnerable \nto chronic pulmonary infections and structural damage.\nAccording to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (2015), \nsymptoms that a child might display before being diagnosed \nwith CF include salty-tasting skin; frequent respiratory \ninfections; coughing; wheezing; symptoms of failure to \nthrive; bulky, greasy stools; and constipation.\nDiagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis\nThe gold standard for CF diagnosis is a sweat chloride test, \nwhich will demonstrate elevated levels of chloride in the \nchild\u2019s sweat. The noninvasive application of pilocarpine \nalong with a low level of electrical stimulation will cause a \nchild to produce sweat onto a gauze, filter paper, or plastic \ncoil, which is then tested for abnormally high sodium \nand chloride levels. The test can take as long as 1 hour to \ncomplete. Infants from birth to 6 months with sweat test \nresults of greater than or equal to 60 mmol/L are consid\u00ad\nered positive for this disease (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, \n2015). Children with a level of 40 to 59 mmol/L or more \nare identified as having a possible positive finding, and \nthose with a level of 60 mmol/L or greater have a positive \nfinding (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2015).\nRespiratory infections, bronchitis, atelectasis, pneu\u00ad\nmonia, and respiratory failure may all indicate a possible \ndiagnosis of CF. Intestinal dysfunctions associated with \nCF include malabsorption of fat and vitamins A, D, E, \nand K; gallbladder disease; meconium ileus; diabetes; and \nnutritional deficiencies.\nMedian survival for individuals with CF is approximately \n37 years for females and 40 years for males (MacKenzie \net\u00a0al., 2014).\nRisk Factors for Cystic Fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis occurs in 1 in 2500 Caucasian births and 1 \nin 17,000 African American births.

Bronchiolitis can manifest \nin any age group throughout the developmental period, \nbut rarely occurs in children older than 2 years. When \nbronchiolitis is acquired during infancy, the child can be \nvery symptomatic. Infants, with their immature immune \nsystems and lack of immunoglobulins, can develop serious \npulmonary infections that require hospitalization. Young \ninfants have anatomic differences that increase their risk \nfor prolonged infection. For example, their relatively few \nimmunoglobulins available to fight infection, coupled \nwith fewer cilia to help remove the infectious material, can \ncause the infant\u2019s infection to take a more serious course.\nThe pathology of viral bronchiolitis is related to the \nrapid downward progression of the virus from the upper \nairways to the lower airways, which leads to significant \ninflammation, edema, and mucus production. The virus \ncauses the infected cells to fuse with surrounding cells \nand subsequently destroy cilia in the clumped cells. The \nmucus and exudates produced cause blockage of the small \nairways, which can then lead to atelectasis (lung collapse). \nThe infant with bronchiolitis frequently needs secretion \nmanagement, positioning, and oxygen to breathe effectively.\nOther symptoms of bronchiolitis include nasal congestion, \ncough, irritability, fever, wheezing, rhonchi, fine crackles, \nnasal flaring, retractions, and cough with or without cya\u00ad\nnosis.

Male gender, \nrespiratory infections \nsuch as RSV and \npneumonia, feeding \nissues, and prematurity \nare all associated \nwith\u00a0ALTEs.\nNursing care for a child who has \ndisplayed an ALTE focuses on ongoing \nassessments (apnea monitors, \ncardiac monitoring, and frequent \nassessments especially during \nprocedures, blood draws, eating, and \ncrying) and assisting with diagnostics \nto determine the underlying \ncause. Parents of a child who has \nexperienced an ALTE should be taught \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\nEpiglottitis\nA medical emergency caused \nby a bacterial infection, \nHaemophilus influenzae type B, \nthat leads to acute inflammation \nof the epiglottis (the cartilage \nat the base of the tongue, \nwhich prevents aspiration when \nswallowing), with the potential \nfor extreme respiratory distress \nand complete upper airway \nobstruction. Medical history \nincludes a sudden onset of \nsymptoms followed by drooling, \ndysphagia, dystonia, significant \nretractions, and stridor. Tripod \npositioning in young children is \ncommon.\nMedical management \nincludes rapid \nidentification of the \ninfectious process and \nimmediate administration \nof antibiotics, steroids, \nand oxygen. Airway \nsupport is essential. Some \nchildren in the acute \nphase will need to have a \ntracheostomy placed.\nA tongue depressor should never be \nused to assist in visualization of an \ninflamed epiglottis, as spasm, further \ninflammation, and complete upper \nairway obstruction can occur. Primary \nnursing care includes immediate \nacquisition and administration \nof antibiotics and steroids, close \nmonitoring of clinical status, following \nof arterial blood gases (ABGs), and \nadministration of intravenous fluids.\n224\t\nChapter 16\u2003 Gas Exchange and\u00a0Oxygenation\n", "Pathology\nDefinition\nMedical Treatment\nNursing Care Tips\nRespiratory distress \nsyndrome\nAssociated with a premature \ninfant\u2019s immature lungs.

The condition causes the \nsoft larynx to collapse inward \nduring inhalation (Children\u2019s \nHospital of Philadelphia, 2017).\nMedical treatment \nconsists of surgery if the \ncondition is severe and \naffects the child\u2019s growth \nand development. Most \ninfants will outgrow this \ncondition by the mid-\ntoddler period.\nNursing care consists of assessing the \ninfant for respiratory distress, apnea \nand bradycardia, and eating habits. \nIf the infant is displaying respiratory \ndistress, increasing discomfort, or \ninability to nurse or suck a bottle \neffectively and has decreased \nnutritional intake, the primary provider \nmust be notified immediately.\nLaryngotracheo\u00ad\nbronchitis (croup)\nAcute inflammation, edema, \nand mucus production within \nthe larynx, trachea, and \nbronchi caused by a virus such \nas parainfluenza, influenza, \nenteroviruses, and respiratory \nsyncytial virus. Symptoms \ninclude mild fever, a deep \n\u201cbarking\u201d cough, inspiratory \nstridor and painful breathing, \nhoarse cry, and, in severe cases, \ncyanosis. Onset may be sudden \nand often occurs at night, and is \nmost common in winter or early \nspring. \nUsually lasting 3\u20135 \ndays, the viral infection \ntakes its course without \ntreatment. Humidified \noxygen may help to thin \nout secretions for more \neffective clearance and to \nreduce the inflammation \nand swelling causing the \ncroupy cough.\nNursing care consists of teaching par\u00ad\nents strategies to minimize discomfort \nand avoid obstruction. Caregivers \nshould encourage quiet, rest, and fluid \nintake, but avoid cough medicines. \nBringing the child into a steamy bath\u00ad\nroom for 10 minutes may help allevi\u00ad\nate coughing, and holding the child \nin a sitting position can aid breathing. \nParents should be advised to keep \nclose watch on the child\u2019s condition \nand call the healthcare provider imme\u00ad\ndiately in the following circumstances:\n\u203a\u203a\nThe rate of respiration increases or \nthe child has any other difficulty \nbreathing, including retractions.\n\u203a\u203a\nExposure to humidity or steam \ndoes not improve coughing.\n\u203a\u203a\nNostril flaring or a bluish \nappearance of the skin around the \nnose or lips develops.\n\u203a\u203a\nThe child begins to drool or is \nunable to swallow; this may \nindicate epiglottitis, which is a \nmedical emergency.\nTABLE 16-1\u2003\nPediatric Respiratory Infections and Conditions: Definitions, Pathology, and Treatment\u2002 (continued)\n(continues)\n\t\nBronchiolitis\t\n225\n", "Pathology\nDefinition\nMedical Treatment\nNursing Care Tips\nNasopharyngitis\nThe \u201ccommon cold\u201d; a viral \ninfection that can be caused by \nmore than 200 identified viruses. \nSymptoms include fatigue, \nsneezing, coughing, itchy watery \neyes, upper and lower airway \ncongestion, and sore throat. The \ninfection is readily transmitted \nto \u00a0others through droplets.\nTreatment consists of \nsupportive care, rest, \nsecretion control by \nsuctioning (infants), \nanalgesics, humidification, \nfluids, and antipyretics as \nneeded.\nNursing care is supportive. Provide \nuninterrupted periods of rest, adequate \nfluids (the child may need 1.5 times the \nmaintenance volume), and infection \ncontrol practices.\nOtitis media (OM)\nA middle ear infection caused \nby either a virus or a bacterium. \nIt often progresses from an \ninfection that migrated up the \nyoung child\u2019s shorter, narrower \nand more linear (straighter) \neustachian tube. OM can be \ndirectly caused by a respiratory \ninfection, tonsillitis, or adenitis. \nSigns and symptoms include \near pain or tugging at ears, \nirritability, fever, decreased \nappetite, and fluid drainage \nfrom the ear.\nAntibiotics are \nadministered for OM \nonly if there is clinical \nevidence of a bacterial \ninfection. A higher white \nblood cell count, fever, \nand visualization of pus \nbehind the tympanic \nmembrane are clinical \nindicators of bacterial OM. \nFor viral OM, the treatment \nis supportive only, with \nantipyretics and analgesics. \nA surgical tympanoplasty \nwith myringotomy \n(tympanic membrane \ntube placement) may be \nrequired with chronic OM.\nNursing care includes symptom \nmanagement for ear pain, fever \ncontrol, fluid intake, and teaching. \nParents should be taught not to \nput their infants to bed with bottles \nand should be counseled to avoid \nexposing children to tobacco smoke \nto reduce risk of OM. Education on \nthe complications of repeated OM \nincludes hearing loss with associated \ndelays in speech development, learning \ndifficulties, and developmental delays.\nPertussis \n(whooping \ncough)\nA serious bacterial infection \nof the lungs caused by the \ninfectious agent Bordetella \npertussis. It is spread by direct \ncontact or droplet. Pertussis \npresents in three stages: \n(1)\u00a0the catarrhal stage, which \nincludes early upper respiratory \nsymptoms (1\u20132 weeks in length); \n(2) the paroxysmal stage, which \nis characterized by frequent \ncough (a burst of rapid, short \ncoughs followed by a sudden \n\u201cwhooping\u201d inspiration, at times \naccompanied with cyanosis), \nmostly at night (4\u20136 weeks in \nlength); and (3) the convalescent \nstage, with gradual recovery and \nless frequent coughing, although \noccasional paroxysms may \nrecur if a subsequent respiratory \ninfection is contracted.\nTreatment consists \nof antimicrobial \ntherapy with agents \nsuch as erythromycin, \nazithromycin, or \nclarithromycin.\nParents should be educated about \nprevention of pertussis via vaccine. \nNursing care of the child includes \nproviding antimicrobial therapy, fluids, \nrest, and oxygen. The infant might \nneed to be admitted to the pediatric \nintensive care unit if complications \noccur. Pneumonia, apnea, and \natelectasis may occur. Severe cough \ncan cause prolapsed rectum, hernia, \nrib fractures in teens, and incontinence \n(American Academy of Pediatrics, \nCommittee on Infectious Diseases, \n2009).\nTABLE 16-1\u2003\nPediatric Respiratory Infections and Conditions: Definitions, Pathology, and Treatment\u2002 (continued)\n226\t\nChapter 16\u2003 Gas Exchange and\u00a0Oxygenation\n", "a chest X-ray may be ordered.

In severe cases where pneumonia is also suspected, \nPathology\nDefinition\nMedical Treatment\nNursing Care Tips\nPneumonia\nA lower respiratory tract \ninfection that causes inflamed \nlung parenchyma. The source of \ninfection may be viral, bacterial, \nfungal, or mycoplasma \nmicrobes. Symptoms include \ncough, tachypnea, fever, and \nshortness of breath.\nMedical treatment for \npneumonia will depend \non whether the infectious \nprocess is viral or bacterial \nin origin. Antibiotics are \nrequired for bacterial \npneumonia.\nNursing care for a child with \npneumonia will include rest, fluids, \nantipyretics, analgesics, oxygen, \ninfection control measures, and \nantibiotics if warranted.\nTuberculosis (TB) \nAn infection caused by the \nbacterium Mycobacterium \ntuberculosis. This chronic and \nhighly contagious infection \nspreads via droplet nuclei. \nThe infection centers on the \npulmonary system, but it can \nalso affect the genitourinary and \nGI systems, bones, joints, and \nskin. Classic clinical presentations \ninclude chronic cough, night \nsweats, weight loss, sputum \nproduction, and fevers. Active TB \nindicates current infection; latent \nTB is demonstrated by a positive \nTB skin test but the bacteria are \nnot active.\nMedical treatment for \nTB in children includes \ntaking up to several \nanti-TB medicines for \nseveral (6\u20139) months \n(CDC, 2014). \nNursing care is mainly supportive. \nThe child will be treated at home. \nEducating the family on adherence to \nthe anti-TB medication is imperative, \nas resistance may develop. Education \non nutrition, rest, home/environment \nassessment, avoidance of public \nfacilities, hand washing, and screening \nof relatives to identify latent TB is also \nimportant in managing a potential \noutbreak.\nTonsillitis and \nadenoiditis\nInflammation of the tonsils, \nwhich can be bacterial or viral \nin origin. Most children present \nwith severe sore throat with \npus-covered tonsils and fever.\nTreatment for tonsillitis \ndepends on the \nchild\u2019s overall clinical \npresentation. If infection \nof a bacterial origin is \nsuspected, antibiotics will \nbe ordered. Serial bouts \nof tonsillitis will lead to \nsurgical or laser removal \nof the tonsils.\nNursing care for a child with \ntonsillitis includes preoperative \nand postoperative care. Symptom \nmanagement is a high priority prior to \nsurgery. Assessing the child\u2019s airway \nafter surgery, especially for continuous \nswallowing that may indicate \nbleeding, is a priority.\nTABLE 16-1\u2003\nPediatric Respiratory Infections and Conditions: Definitions, Pathology, and Treatment\u2002 (continued)\n\t\nBronchiolitis\t\n227\n", "keep the young child\u2019s oxygen saturation greater than 90% \nis commonly ordered (Table 16-2 describes oxygen delivery \nsystems).

May \nbe difficult to secure and maintain on young children who are frightened of the mask. Provides \nonly 35\u201355% FiO2 with oxygen delivery at 6\u201310 L/min. Should be attached to a humidification \nsystem for oxygen flows of 4 L/min or greater for comfort and decreased nasal tissue drying.\nOxygen blow-by\nAdministers very low levels of oxygen mixed with room air. Often larger tubing is placed by the \nchild\u2019s face without touching the child. Provides only small amounts of oxygen for children in \nlow-level distress or need.\nOxygen tent\nPlastic tent placed over the crib that provides humidified oxygen at up to 50% FiO2. Requires \nfrequent assessment for moisture and leaks in the setup.\nNonrebreathing mask\nUsed when a child is in moderate to high levels of respiratory distress. The mask system \nprovides up to 100% FiO2 by not allowing the child to rebreathe exhaled CO2. It fits snugly on \nthe child\u2019s face and has a reservoir bag that may or may not inflate.\nPartial nonrebreathing mask\nProvides oxygen at approximately 60\u201395% FiO2. The mask does not provide a valve that \ncompletely prevents CO2 from entering back into the child\u2019s lungs\u2014hence, its \u201cpartial \nnonrebreathing\u201d name.\nVenturi mask\nUsed when a child needs a specific quantity of oxygen mixed with room air. Color-coded \nvalves provide different mixtures depending on the quantity and percent oxygen required.\nOxygen hood\nLarge plastic device that fits over the infant\u2019s entire head and provides a high concentration of \noxygen. It requires frequent assessments for tolerance and skin integrity.\nPositive end-expiratory \npressure device\nUsed when the child needs positive end-expiratory pressure to help keep the alveoli open, \nespecially when a child has an acute exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary condition.\nTracheostomy mask\nA device that loosely fits over a child\u2019s tracheostomy to provide humidified oxygen.\nVentilator\nUsed for a critically ill intubated child who requires mechanical ventilation. This machine \nprovides support for a child who cannot maintain an independent and effective respiratory \nrate and depth. It requires several individually set parameters, including inspiratory length, rate, \nand depth, and oxygen concentration (often titrated). The sophisticated machinery requires \nprecise care provided by a team of physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists. The goal of \nuse is to wean the child from the ventilator as soon as possible.\nResuscitative bag/mask/valve\nA device that should be present at every child\u2019s bedside, in all clinic rooms, and on crash carts. \nIt is used to provide emergency resuscitation breathing for a child in extreme distress or who is \nnot breathing. The mask must fit the child\u2019s facial structures well to produce an adequate seal.\nRisk Factors for Bronchiolitis\nWinter months, attendance of daycare programs, exposure \nto second-hand smoke, reactive airway disease, and not \nbreastfeeding are risk factors for the development of serious \nbronchiolitis.

The syringe must be compressed prior to plac\u00ad\ning it in the infant\u2019s or young child\u2019s nose, and then gently \ninflated to remove secretions. The mucus should be squirted \nout immediately and the bulb cleaned with soap and water \nafter each use.\nOlive Tip\nThis device is used by nurses and respiratory therapists to \nrapidly remove secretions causing a child distress. The olive \ntip is placed into each nare with the valve open, then rapid \non-and-off movements on the valve will pull secretions from \nthe child\u2019s nose and pharynx. The device should be cleansed \non a regular basis. Keep the tip on the suction tubing ready \nfor use.\nDeep Sterile Suctioning\nSevere mucus production may require deep sterile suction\u00ad\ning. This procedure is performed by the nurse or respiratory \ntherapist. Sterile kits are used only once and then disposed \nof. This procedure is considered invasive, with the potential \nto inflict pulmonary structure damage, and should be per\u00ad\nformed by professional healthcare team members only with \na physician\u2019s order.\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nThe Common Cold\nSome viruses that cause the common cold can produce more \nserious illnesses in infants and toddlers. In these populations, \nmucus production is increased throughout their smaller \nairways, inflammation causes edema in the upper airway, \nfevers can be very high, and irritability ensues with sore throat, \npersistent cough, and decreased desire to eat and drink. Rest, \nfluids, secretion management, suctioning if needed with a \nbulb syringe, and good hand hygiene are all supportive care \nfor the infant or child with the common cold virus.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against the \nuse of over-the-counter cold and cough medicines in children \nyounger than 2 years. The efficacy of these medications in \nrelieving symptoms is unproven and may be limited, and many \nparents are unaware of the potential for harm if medications \nwith the same ingredients are given simultaneously, leading \nto overdose. Some medications are also prone to abuse.\nWhen their children have colds, parents should be advised \nto encourage intake of fluids, particularly warm, clear beverages \nsuch as tea or broth. In older children, honey may be used \nto soothe an irritated throat and calm coughing, although \nparents of infants should be advised to avoid the use honey. \nTopically applied menthol vapor rubs may also provide some \nsymptom relief.\nData from Carr, 2006; \u201cColds in Children,\u201d 2005; Sharfstein, North, & \nSerweint, 2007.\n\t\nBronchiolitis\t\n229\n", "\u25c6\u25c6Assessments for respiratory distress should begin with \nvisual observation of the child\u2019s overall appearance and \ncondition. Work of breathing must be assessed, and level \nof consciousness, positioning, overall distress, interac\u00ad\ntive behaviors, and skin color should all be observed.\n\u25c6\u25c6The pediatric nurse must have equipment close at hand \nthat will assist the team in securing a patent airway, \nproviding support for ventilation and oxygenation, and \ncontrolling the child\u2019s symptoms of respiratory distress.\n\u25c6\u25c6Reactive airway disease, which may precede a diagnosis \nof asthma, is associated with risk factors such as expo\u00ad\nsure to respiratory infections, cigarette smoke, allergens, \nand other triggers. Family members must be assisted in \nidentifying their child\u2019s triggers so that they can prevent \nrepeated exposures and subsequent episodes of asthma.\n\u25c6\u25c6Educating the child and family about home care of \nasthma includes teaching about the individualized \nasthma action plan, rapid-acting medications, preven\u00ad\ntive medications, the signs and symptoms of an asthma \nattack, the child\u2019s known triggers, and when to call for \nimmediate help.\n\u25c6\u25c6Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disor\u00ad\nder that causes cysts and scarring within the pancreas, \npreventing the normal secretion of digestive enzymes \nChapter Summary\n\u25c6\u25c6Respiratory illness is a common reason why families \nseek pediatric health care, and is a common cause of \nillness throughout childhood.\n\u25c6\u25c6The concepts of gas exchange and oxygenation in the \npediatric population relate to the initial newborn period, \nwhen extra-uterine respiration is initiated, and continue \nto be critical throughout the developmental period of \nchildhood. The most vulnerable period for the newborn \nin terms of respiration is the first 24 hours of life.\n\u25c6\u25c6The anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system \ncan be divided into the upper passageways (nasal cavi\u00ad\nties, pharynx, larynx, and trachea, plus nasal cilia) and \nthe lower air passageways (main bronchi, bronchioles, \nand alveoli).\n\u25c6\u25c6There are both anatomic and physiological differences \nin the respiratory systems of children and adults. These \ndifferences, such as a smaller, narrower airway, contribute \nto the development of respiratory conditions in children.\n\u25c6\u25c6Insufficient intake of oxygen and removal of carbon \ndioxide can cause a child with respiratory distress to \nexperience hypoxemia; low levels of oxygen in the blood \ncan rapidly develop into hypoxia.\nCase Study\nKaty, a 3-year-old child with a history of reactive airway disease, \nhas come to the emergency department for the third time \nin less than 6 months.

This section of epidermis develops in the latter \npart of the third trimester of gestation. A neonate in the \nneonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may require routine \nactivities such as handling, bathing, exposure to chemicals \nand cleansers, placement of intravenous catheters, and use \nof adhesives to attach temperature probes and IV catheters. \nUnfortunately, all of these activities can break down the \nintegrity of the neonate\u2019s skin. Consequently, such infants \nhave a high risk of dehydration through insensible water loss.\nThe body surface area of neonates and children is rela\u00ad\ntively larger than the body surface of adults. In addition, \nneonates\u2019 skin is much more permeable, which leads to a \ngreater sensitivity to external irritants and an increased \nsusceptibility to opportunistic infections in these chil\u00ad\ndren. Great care must be given to these fragile premature \npatients. They are kept in humidified isolettes to prevent \ndehydration for approximately 1 month after birth. The \nbabies are gently handled every 4 hours in the beginning \nof their NICU stay to allow developmental growth. Their \nisolettes are covered with dark covers to prevent light from \ndisturbing their premature eyes. The neonates are reposi\u00ad\ntioned using a \u201chands-on\u201d technique to prevent pressure \nulcers and moved gently with their hands crossed over their \nchest for comfort. Slow movement of very early neonates \n(less than 28 weeks\u2019 gestation) can prevent the fragile \nblood vessels in the brain from bleeding. Soft blankets, \nsynthetic sheepskin and bendable soft supports are used to \ncreate \u201cnests\u201d that keep them in a fetal position with body \nalignment. Bathing should be limited to sterile saline the \nfirst week, followed by minimal use of soap every 4 days.\nIntroduction\nThe integumentary system, or skin, is the largest organ in \nthe body. Through its extensive network of blood vessels, \nhuman skin receives one-third of the body\u2019s total circulating \nblood. There are two main types of skin: (1) the hairless \nglabrous skin found on the palms and soles of the feet \nand (2) hair-bearing skin. The skin has three layers\u2014the \nepidermis, the dermis, and the subcutaneous layer. Acting \nas a physical barrier that protects the internal organs and \nstructures, the skin also performs thermoregulation, sense \nperception, and self-cleaning functions.\nThe top layer of the skin, the epidermis, consists of dead \nskin cells that are constantly brushed off and regrow monthly, \nthereby preventing bacterial colonization. The epidermis \ncontains melanin, which gives the skin its color. Within \nthe epidermis are two distinct sublayers: the stratum layer, \nwhich is made up of the corneum, lucidum, granulosum, \nspinosum, and basale strata layers; and the basal layer. These \nsublayers contain four types of cells: keratinocytes, melano\u00ad\ncytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. The complex layers \nof skin are nourished via diffusion of substances from the \ndermis. In addition, the dermis contains hair follicles with \narrector pili muscles, eccrine (sweat) glands, blood vessels, \nand nerve endings. In the pediatric population, 1 square inch \nof skin contains approximately 650 eccrine (sweat) glands, \n20 blood vessels, 60,000 melanocytes, and 1000 nerve endings.\nAcross the developmental period, some diseases and \ngenetic anomalies can be diagnosed based on discolor\u00ad\nation and lesions of the skin. Many pediatric clinic visits \ninvolve skin disorders. Notably, the development of skin \nloss, blisters, and lesions is very common in children. \nInfants are especially vulnerable to skin damage, as their \nepidermis is loosely bound to their dermis, leading to \npoor adherence of skin layers. Damage to the epidermis \nand dermis can lead to a secondary infection. The deep\u00ad\nest layer of the skin, which consists of subcutaneous fat, \nprovides an anchor for the dermis to the bone and muscle \nvia connective tissue; this fat layer also assists with tem\u00ad\nperature regulation.\nDevelopment of Skin Across Childhood\nThe outermost layers of the epidermis, or stratum corneum, \nare not completely developed in preterm infants. As a result, \nskin barrier function\u2014that is, the ability of skin to protect \nthe body from toxins and pathogenic organisms\u2014is weaker \nin this vulnerable population. Skin barrier function can \nbe measured by determining the skin\u2019s ability to hold on \nto water and to stay hydrated, which is influenced by the \npH (acid\u2012base balance).\nBEST PRACTICES\nKeeping Lesions Moist\nIn the past, nursing care encouraged the drying out of the \nbase of a wound. Today, best evidence supports the provision \nof a moist wound base. Epithelial cells fill in the wound and \nrequire moisture for their maximum growth and stability. If \nwet to dry dressing changes are ordered, discuss the appro\u00ad\npriateness of the order with the physician. Maintaining sterile \nwet to wet dressing changes frequently enough to provide \nwound base moisture will promote healing.\nPromotion of Skin Health Across \nChildhood\nPrinciples of pediatric skin management should be based \non early identification and immediate treatment of skin \n\t\nPromotion of Skin Health Across Childhood\t\n233\n", "The various skin lesions that a pediatric nurse may en\u00ad\ncounter while caring for children across the developmental \nperiod are described in Table 17-1. A primary skin lesion \nis the initial change of skin integrity, whereas a secondary \nskin lesion evolves from poor healing due to picking, \nscratching, or infection of a primary lesion.\nA common disorder observed in newborns is ery\u00ad\nthema toxicum neonatorum (Figure 17-2). Referred to as \n\u201cflea-bite dermatitis,\u201d these small papules of white and red \ncolor appear on the face and trunk. This is a self-resolving \ncondition, although the presence of the papules causes \nconcern for parents. The pediatric nurse should provide \nanticipatory guidance and teaching to parents that they \nshould not squeeze or attempt to pop the papules, as they \nwill resolve without intervention.\nconditions. Protection against excessive sun exposure and \nsunburn should be emphasized, as such exposures increase \nthe risk of skin cancers later in life. Common childhood \nskin conditions include rashes (exanthems), burns, bug \nbites, cellulitis, scratches, wounds, bruising, acne, eczema, \nurticaria (hives), fungal infections (tinea pedis, tinea capitus, \nand tinea corporis), impetigo, and parasites such as scabies.\nNumerous types of lesions may even be present at birth. \nThe pediatric nurse should assess a newborn\u2019s entire skin \nsurface for congenital skin lesions such as hemangiomas, \ncongenital melanocytic nevi, and salmon patches or \nMongolian spots (Figure 17-1). Although such lesions are \nusually benign, screening for them at birth offers the nurse \nan opportunity to educate the parents as to their nature, as \nwell as allows for identification of any more problematic \nlesions such as skin vesicles, which should prompt evalu\u00ad\nation for congenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, \nor caf\u00e9 au lait spots, which might be an early sign of rare \ndisorders such as neurofibromatosis or McCune-Albright \nsyndrome (Lewis, 2014).\nFAMILY EDUCATION \nPrevention of Sunburns\n\u2022\t Five or more sunburns in childhood can lead to an \n80% increased chance of melanoma later in life.\n\u2022\t Babies have the most sensitive skin, which contains \nlittle melanin.

Bites, rashes such as poison oak or sumac, \neczema, and hives all produce great discomfort for children \nand lead them to itch and scratch their skin excessively. Se\u00ad\nvere itching can disrupt sleep and cause fussiness as well as \nemotional distress. \nMany over-the-counter medications such as calamine \nlotion and topical or oral antipruritics (antihistamines) are \navailable to treat itching, but children can also benefit from \ntreatments consisting of simple ingredients. A paste made \nfrom baking soda or oatmeal gently placed over a rash can \nbe very soothing. Cool washcloths (not heat) can also be \nsoothing. Cornstarch should not be used, as it may encourage \ntopical fungal infections. \nOral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) \ncan be dangerous in younger children (younger than 4 years) \nFigure 17-2\u2002 A young infant with erythema toxicum neonatorum. \nDavid Gee / Alamy Stock Photo\nFigure 17-3\u2002 Scabies tracts. \n\u00a9 CNRI/Science Source\nBEST PRACTICES\nPreventing Secondary Infections\nOlder infants and young children are unable to maintain \nhygienic hands. When they touch their mouth, the mouths \nof others, and their peri-area, they frequently touch their skin \nlesions, thereby putting themselves at risk for the develop\u00ad\nment of infection. The pediatric nurse should place soft \ncotton mittens on infants old enough to reach body parts, \nand highly discourage toddlers and preschool children from \ntouching their lesions with contaminated hands. Soft arm \nrestraints (often called \u201cNo-No\u2019s\u201d) are effective in preventing \na child from scratching, biting, or contaminating a wound \nthat requires healing.\nand should not be administered at all (Food and Drug Admin\u00ad\nistration [FDA], 2008, 2016). Older school-age children should \nnot be given such medications unless under the direction of \na primary care provider. Part of the reason for these cautions \nis that the pharmacokinetics of such medications in young \nchildren may differ notably from the response in adults. In \nan early study of the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine \n(Simons, Watson, Martin, Chen, & Simons, 1990), for example, \nit was found that the drug has a significantly shorter serum \nhalf-life in children than in adults, but children\u2019s clearance \nrates are nearly four times as long as the adult rates, offering a \ngreater potential for toxicity when diphenhydramine is dosed \nrepeatedly in young children.\nConcept Exemplars\nMany potential skin lesions, rashes, and infections can \npresent during the developmental period. This chapter \npresents four exemplars of these conditions: burns, contact \ndermatitis, pediculosis, and acne. Table 17-2 summarizes \nother common skin infections and conditions, including \ntheir etiology, clinical presentation, treatments, and family \neducation needs.\nBurns\nA burn is damage to the skin and other tissues caused by \nheat, chemicals, electricity, sunlight, or radiation. Burns \nare the most common household injury for children. In \nthe United States, approximately 300 children visit the \nemergency department (ED) due to injuries sustained from \nburns each day (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n[CDC], 2016), for a total of more than 100,000 ED visits \nfor this cause each year.

Reverse isolation is used to prevent \na burn wound from becoming infected.\nWhen assessing a wound, the pediatric nurse should \nuse a marker to outline the wound\u2019s perimeter. The date \nand time of the marking should be visible on the skin or \nbody area. If a wound extends beyond the perimeter of \nthe markings, the wound is expanding and not healing. \nThis expansion could reflect the development of cellulitis, \ninfection, or sinus tracts.\nThe rule of nines is used in adults and teens to deter\u00ad\nmine total body surface area damaged by burns. In the \npediatric patient, a Lund-Browder chart is used for this \npurpose (Figure 17-4).\nMedical Treatment\nWith superficial burns, the wound may need cool com\u00ad\npresses, application of aloe vera, and symptom manage\u00ad\nment. Partial-thickness burns will require wound care \n(Figure 17-5). Thorough cleaning and the application of \na silver sulfadiazine cream may be sufficient.\nFor full-thickness burns, fluid resuscitation is the pri\u00ad\nmary concern and hypovolemic shock must be prevented. \nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and airway support \nmay be required if the child\u2019s pulmonary system was ex\u00ad\nposed to heat and smoke. Loss of serum protein via wound \nweeping may require IV replacement with human albumin \nor total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The child should be \nplaced on a nothing-by-mouth (NPO) status to prevent \nparalytic ileus. If the surface area of the burn was large \nenough to destroy a significant quantity of cells, laboratory \nAssessment\nBurns are classified as first-, second-, or third-degree \nburns, which are equivalent to the terms superficial, \npartial-thickness, and full-thickness burns. One wound \nmay have several degrees of thickness damage due to the \ntype of agent and the amount of time that the skin was \nexposed to the irritant. The skin is thinner on the ears, \nbacks of the hands, tops of the feet, and perineum, so \nburns to these areas tend to cause more serious damage in \nterms of thickness. For instance, a mild sunburn is a first-\ndegree or superficial burn, appearing red without blisters \nand pain. The top layer of skin is damaged and will peel \naway in a few days. By comparison, partial-thickness or \nsecond-degree burns can lead to redness and blistering, \nand parts of the dermis will be damaged. These wounds \nwill appear damp and heal within 10 days. People with \nmore melanocytes (darker skin tones) can lose their pig\u00ad\nmentation in these burns.\nDeep partial-thickness burns are difficult to differentiate \nfrom full-thickness burns and are considered third-degree \nburns. In this cases, there is more damage to the dermis, \nand the wounds can appear white and waxy. No capillary \nrefill occurs in the burn tissues, and the nerve endings are \ndestroyed. With deeper burns, there is a high risk for fluid \nand serum protein loss through weeping. The healing time \ncan be 3 weeks, with scarring and possible contractures \noccurring.

In this case, the dermatitis is directly related \nto the child\u2019s perineum being exposed to and aggravated \nby acidic excrement. Prolonged exposure causes a bright \nred macular\u2012papular rash with weeping lesions. The infant \nwill present with mild redness that progresses to swelling, \nblisters, thickening of the skin around the diaper, scaling, \ncrusting, and oozing of fluids. In older children, contact \ndermatitis can be caused by any number of irritants\u2014for \nexample, poison ivy, harsh soaps or volatile chemicals (e.g., \nbleach), metals (e.g., nickel, chrome), or allergens such as \nlatex or dyes in beauty products (American Academy of \nDermatology, n.d.).\nTreatment and Nursing Care\nWhen treating diaper dermatitis, the child\u2019s diaper should \nbe removed and the skin cleansed immediately after the \nchild urinates or stools. The skin should be washed com\u00ad\npletely and gently twice a day, with the removal of all layers \nof topical treatment and excrements. The skin should be \ngently cleansed with soft cotton cleansing cloths rather than \ncommercial wipes, which can contain alcohol and other \nharsh detergents. All folds of the skin should be cleansed \nwell and patted dry. The skin should have a thick layer of \nvitamin A, vitamin D, and/or zinc oxide protective cream \napplied. The creams should be left on after diaper changes, \nexcept during the twice-daily complete cleansing. Nursing \neducation should include promoting open diaper time to \nexpose the skin to air and not using plastic materials or \nplastic diaper coverings. The family should be encouraged \nto reduce the child\u2019s stool pH by increasing the consump\u00ad\ntion of veggies and fruits.\nFor contact dermatitis in infants beyond the diaper area \nas well as in older children, the skin should be cleansed well \nand patted dry; solutions such as Aveeno baths, Burrow\u2019s \nsolution, or calamine lotion can then be applied to pro\u00ad\nmote healing. If severe itching occurs, oral antihistamines \nor hydroxyzine (Atarax) can be used. Emollient lotions \nmay be used if the skin appears dry, but their use should \nbe discontinued if symptoms increase in response to the \nlotion. If episodes recur, allergy \u201cpatch\u201d testing may be \nneeded to determine the cause of the reaction so that it can \nbe avoided (Wentworth et\u00a0al., 2014). Bacterial overgrowth \ncan occur and may require oral antibiotics.\nPediculosis Humanus Capitus (Head Lice)\nHead lice infestations are a common skin infection during \nchildhood. Lice readily pass between children through \nsharing of common objects such as combs, brushes, hats, \nover-the-head clothing, and dress-up clothes, and through \nexposure to infested car upholstery, car seat linings, bedding, \nand carpets. Lice do not fly; rather, they need an object \nto pass the mature lice or eggs (nits) between children \ntests should be monitored to assess the need for packed \nred blood cell infusions, and to determine whether renal \nfunction is declining.\nEmergency fluid boluses, fluid maintenance, and fluid \nresuscitation may all be required for large body surface \narea burns. To calculate the amount of fluid needed in the \nfirst 24 hours to replace fluid lost through the wound, the \nParkland formula is generally used. This formula, which was \ndeveloped by Charles Baxter at Parkland Hospital at South\u00ad\nwestern University Medical Center in the 1960s (Hansen, \n2008), states that the volume of fluid required = 4 \u00d7 body \nmass (in kg) \u00d7 percentage of total body surface area en\u00ad\ncompassed by the burn. Be aware that some sources argue \nthat this formula overestimates the fluids needed for fluid \nresuscitation (Guilabert et\u00a0al., 2016).\nNursing Care\nMaintaining aseptic technique to prevent a secondary \ninfection in a burn wound is a primary nursing concern. \nThe child\u2019s symptoms should be managed carefully by \nadministering the most appropriate pain assessment tool \nand giving pain management medications. The child will \nneed emotional support and the family will need clear com\u00ad\nmunication concerning all aspects of care. Bringing in the \nassistance of Child Life specialists to provide distraction, \nmedical play, and education should be a priority in team \nsupport for the child.\nContact Dermatitis\nContact dermatitis is a skin rash that can be caused by a \nvariety of irritants. In infants and toddlers, severe diaper \nrashes are a common form of this condition. Contact der\u00ad\nmatitis or diaper dermatitis is often related to the infant\u2019s \ndiaper (whether cloth or disposable) or products intended \nfor skin care; urine, soap, detergents, perfumes and baby \nlotions are just a few possible irritants (Clark-Gruel, Helmes, \nLawrence, Odio, & White, 2014; Yu, Treat, Chaney, & \nFigure 17-5\u2002 A child with partial-thickness burn. \n\u00a9 Scott Camazine/Science Source\n242\t\nChapter 17\u2003 Skin Integrity\n", "head lice can be irritable and unable to sleep soundly. Some \ndevelop sores and secondary infections from scratching \ntheir scalps. Lice are spread by direct contact from one \ninfected person to another and feed on human blood from \nareas where intense itching has caused abrasions. The most \ncommon age group for infections is 3 to 11 years, and this \ncondition occurs more frequently in girls.\nRisk Factors\nSharing of hats, scarves, coats, and hairbrushes carrying lice \nmay spread the infection. Sharing a bed, pillow, couch, or \nstuffed animal with an infected person allows the parasite \nto readily pass between children. Contrary to common \nbelief, personal hygiene is not related to lice infestations, \nas a female louse prefers to lay her eggs on clean hair rather \nthan oily hair (CDC, 2015).\nMedical Treatment\nPrescription or over-the-counter pediculicides are applied \nto the child\u2019s hair and scalp. Long hair may need two bottles \nof the treatment. The prescription lotions contain benzyl \nalcohol, ivermectin, and malathion; spinosad topical sus\u00ad\npension is an alternative. The over-the-counter medicines \nconsist of pyrethrins and permethrin 5% shampoos. To rid \nthe hair of lice, the hair should be sectioned off in 1-inch \nsquares, with manual extraction of nits and lice then \u00adbeing \nperformed with a fine-toothed comb (nit comb or dog/cat \ncomb). Careful removal of all egg sacs is imperative to \nprevent reinfection. Some businesses will perform the \nextraction of adult lice and nits as a service for a fee.\nNursing Care\nParents and caregivers need to be educated to wash all \nclothing worn the previous two days, linens, towels, and \nwashable toys in a hot-water washing machine (130\u00b0F) \nand then place the items in a hot dryer (130\u00b0F) for at least \n5 minutes. All stuffed animals and excess pillows or any \nitem that cannot be washed should be bagged tightly for a \nminimum of 2 weeks to kill all lice and nits. Hairbrushes \nand combs should be soaked in hot water (130\u00b0F). Parents \nneed to be reminded to vacuum all furniture, floors, and \ncar upholstery thoroughly to remove lice and eggs. Nurses \nmust inform parents and caregivers that fumigants should \nnot be used in the home, because they can be absorbed \nthrough the skin, leading to toxicity.\nWhile head lice are the most common form seen in \nchildren, body lice and pubic lice might also be found in \nadolescents in certain circumstances (e.g., homeless children \nmay present with body lice and sexually active youth with \npubic lice; Flinders & de Schweinitz, 2004). The latter can \nbe identified by direct observation of the pubic region, and \nthe former by examination of the seams of the clothing, \n(CDC, 2015). Classrooms without individual coat racks \nand children\u2019s cubbies for personal item storage are at risk \nfor becoming havens for lice.\nThe female louse needs a host to provide blood for this \nspecies\u2019 survival and reproduction. Adult lice cannot live \nmore than 2 days away from a food source. A female louse \nlives 30 days, lays many hundreds of eggs during her life, \nand adheres the eggs to the hair shaft using a biological \ncement as close to the scalp as possible (Figure 17-6). \nThe egg sacs then open and the nits hatch in 8 to 9 days \n(CDC, 2015). The nits (eggs) can stay alive for 10 to 14 days \nwithout a host.\nAssessment\nChildren with head lice will complain of a severely itchy \nscalp, and white nits (eggs) can be found in the hair. The \nitching is caused by three aspects of the infection: the fast \ncrawling behavior of the six-legged adult parasites, the \npresence of waste products that irritate the skin, and the \nparasites\u2019 eating behaviors as they drink from a well of \nblood from scratched skin and open lesions. Children with \nFigure 17-6\u2002 An adult louse.\nCourtesy of Dr. Dennis Juranek/CDC\n\t\nConcept Exemplars\t\n243\n", "Acne\nAcne, or the accumulation of pimples (comedones, pap\u00ad\nules, pustules, nodules, and or cysts), is caused by blocked \npilosebaceous glands. For teenagers, these lesions are \ntypically found on the face, chest, and back. Acne is the \nmost common skin condition of the older child. Entering \npuberty, an excess of sebum (oily fats) is produced by the \nsebaceous glands. Hair follicles may become plugged with \nkeratinocytes and sebum, leading to the development of \nacne. Contrary to myth, acne is not associated with the \nconsumption of greasy or oily foods. Hormones, menses \ncycles, and excessive sweat all contribute to the develop\u00ad\nment of adolescent acne.\nMedical Treatment\nSuggested treatment for mild acne (comedonal or mixed \nwith papular and pustular) includes thorough washing of \nthe skin twice a day, and the application of a topical benzoyl \nperoxide and topical antimicrobial medication. Alternative \ntreatments include azelaic or 2% salicylic acids. The first-line \nchoices for moderate acne (mixed papular\u2012pustular or \nnodular) are oral antibiotics, topical retinoids, and benzoyl \nperoxides. For severe acne (nodular with conglobate), oral \nisotretinoins are recommended.\nNursing Care\nNursing care includes teaching the adolescent to cleanse \nthe skin gently with oil-free cleansers. Many teens have \nsuccess in using cleansers that contain 2% salicylic acid. \nAdolescents must be encouraged not to pick at their skin \nor pop pimples, as doing so can force the bacteria around \nthe site of the lesion. The application of very warm clean \ncloths to a full pustule may help to drain the contents, and \nis preferred to popping the pustule and spreading the bac\u00ad\nteria manually. Although teens should be informed about \ngood nutrition, they need education on how androgen \nhormones during puberty create more sebum production, \ncausing the lesions.\nwhere body lice sometimes can be located. Treatment of \nthese parasites follows a similar course, although further \neducation in hygiene and prevention may also be needed.\nIf actual lice are not observed, it should be noted that \nparasitic infestations of scabies or bedbugs may produce \nsimilar symptoms (American Academy of Dermatology, \n2010). These infestations should be assessed and treated.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nStevens-Johnson Syndrome: Toxic Epidermal \nNecrolysis\n\u2022\t Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare and severe reac\u00ad\ntion to certain medications.\n\u2022\t It starts out as flu-like symptoms: fever, arthralgia, and \nburning rash on the trunk. The rash begins as macule \nlesions and then progresses to larger vesicles (bullae), \nwhich later rupture.\n\u2022\t The facial and torso skin develop lesions that peel \nand have the appearance of a full-thickness burn. \nThe lesions can affect the conjunctiva and all mucous \nmembranes.\n\u2022\t Stevens-Johnson syndrome can lead to \u00adpneumonia, \nsepsis, multiple-organ failure, and death (10% \nmorbidity).\n\u2022\t It is treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immuno\u00ad\nglobulins, antipyretics, fluid balance and narcotic pain \ncontrol as needed. Use of a patient-controlled analgesia \n(PCA) machine is appropriate with painful lesions on the \nthroat, vagina, urethra, and other epidermal \u00adsurfaces. \nSevere oral lesions require topical anesthetics and \nmouthwashes. Debridement of dead tissue may be re\u00ad\nquired; open lesions after debridement can be soothed \nwith Burow\u2019s solution on nonadhering dressings.\n\u2022\t Children with lesions throughout the mouth, pharynx, \nand esophagus will need total parenteral nutrition \nand intra-lipids.\n\u2022\t Recovery can take weeks.\nData from Foster, C.

These disorders require long-term \nmanagement and sometimes frequent blood product or \nclotting factor transfusions or infusions.\nDevelopmental Issues in Cellular \nRegulation\nBoth oncologic and hematologic disorders can be found \nacross the developmental period. Although a newborn is \nmuch less likely to present with cancer than, for instance, \nan adolescent, there are more than 250 types of childhood \ncancers that can develop at any time during childhood, \nincluding the neonatal period (Orbach et\u00a0al., 2013). The \nmost common forms of neonatal cancer are teratomas, \nneuroblastomas, soft-tissue sarcomas, leukemia (cancer in \ntissues where blood cell production occurs), renal \u00adtumors, \nand brain tumors (Orbach et\u00a0al., 2013). Hematologic \ndisorders such as neonatal thrombocytopenia, hemolytic \nanemia, sickle cell disease, and other blood disorders that \nare present at or develop at birth arise due to a variety of \nmechanisms, although many are genetic in nature (Orkin \net\u00a0al., 2009). Hematologic disorders can also arise from \ncancer treatment, with anemia and neutropenia being \ncommon results of chemotherapy. For this reason, the two \nsubjects are often intertwined.\nIntroduction\nCellular regulation is a concept used to assess health and \nidentify disorders associated with the cells of the lymphoid \nand myeloid cell lines, as well as the development of cancer\u00ad\nous cells and bleeding disorders. In the science of pediat\u00ad\nrics, the concept of cellular regulation opens the door to \ndiscussions of hematologic and oncologic pathologies that \nconcern the health, well-being, development, morbidity, \nand mortality of children from birth through adolescence.\nThe beginnings of most problems in cellular regula\u00ad\ntion during childhood derive from genetic aberrations \nwithin the cells of the bone marrow (Figure 18-1). In the \npresence of normal physiology, the stem cells proliferate \nto form the various types of new cells that are needed by \nthe body: either the myeloid cell line such as neutrophils, \nbasophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes (which produce \nplatelets), monocytes (macrophages), or erythrocytes \n(red blood cells); or the lymphoid cell line, which further \ndifferentiates into humoral cells that produce antibodies \n(B\u00a0cells) and lymphocyte cells that fight infection (T cells). \nLymphocytes are differentiated by their surface proteins \n(markers); T cells are classified into categories that have \nspecific functions, such as CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8.\nStem cells have the capability of developing into many \ndifferent kinds of cells; the process by which normal stem \ncell proliferation and differentiation takes place is called \nhematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis is a complex process that \noccurs in the bone marrow, and it is influenced by a child\u2019s \nhealth state, nutritional status, exposure to toxic sub\u00ad\nstances, genetic background, and other factors.

After birth, the hematopoietic stem cell \nproduces new cell lines in the cavities of the child\u2019s bone \nmarrow. While adult cancers are often related to aging and \nexposure to environmental factors that promote mutations \n(e.g., radiation, pollutants), in children most cancers tend \nto be related to a congenital gene mutation, sometimes \ninherited, that leads to the proliferation of cancer cells. \nFor instance, children with Down syndrome (trisomy \n21) are at higher risk of developing acute lymphocytic \nleukemia (ALL) (National Cancer Institute, 2016b), and \nchildren with certain forms of leukemia who present with \nthe Philadelphia chromosome are at higher risk for poor \noutcomes and shorter survival rates. Children who have \nretinoblastoma have an inherited gene mutation called RB1. \nChildren with documented exposure to ionizing radiation \nhave a much higher chance of developing cancer due to \nmutations to their genetic material that lead to uncontrolled \nabnormal cell growth.\nManagement of the various types of cancer proceeds \naccording to specific and unique treatment plans called \nprotocols. Treatment protocols may follow guidelines \nprovided by organizations such as the Children\u2019s Oncology \nGroup (COG), an international consortium of pediatric \noncologists and clinics that pool data for assessment of \ntreatment regimens and data collection and analysis of \noutcomes. The most common types of cancer in children, \nrepresenting approximately 75% of all pediatric cancer \nFigure 18-2\u2002 A child receiving chemotherapy. \n\u00a9 FatCamera/E+/Getty Images.\ndiagnoses, are leukemias, lymphomas (cancers that develop \nfrom lymphocytes), nephroblastomas (Wilms\u2019 tumor), and \ncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors, including brain \ntumors and neuroblastomas. Leukemias account for ap\u00ad\nproximately 30% of all childhood cancers, and CNS tumors \nfor approximately 32% (American Cancer Society, 2016).\nChildren have a different experience with cancer than \nadults do. During periods of rapid growth, such as during \nthe first year of life (birth to 1 year of age) and during the \nadolescent period, children have a higher risk of compli\u00ad\ncations and cancer progression and decreased response \nto treatment (Figure 18-2). Children often need to take \nmultiple antineoplastic (chemotherapy) drugs over an \nextended period of time to achieve remission.\nAlthough childhood cancer across the developmental \nperiod is rare, the number of new cases (incidence) is rising. \nWith research-based treatments, however, survival rates are \nsteadily improving (National Cancer Institute, 2015a). In \n1975, a simple majority of childhood cancer victims had a \n5-year survival rate (50%), but as of 2010, that percentage \nhad increased to 80% (National Cancer Institute, 2015a). \nSurvival rates depend on the age of the child at diagnosis, \nthe administration of multidrug treatments, and the type of \ncancer. Survival rates for acute leukemia have skyrocketed \nand now exceed 90%. Unfortunately, other, less common \nchildhood cancers continue to have low survival rates. \nOverall, mortality rates are declining due to the effective\u00ad\nness of the cancer treatment protocols for children.\nBecause of the use of multiple drugs and/or radiation \ntherapy delivered at high doses relative to their body surface \narea (BSA) to treat their cancer, children who have had a \nchildhood cancer diagnosis are at risk for the development \nof \u201clate effects\u201d such as chronic illness or even a secondary \ncancer in later childhood or in adulthood (National Cancer \nInstitute, 2016a). Lifelong surveillance is required, to include \nblood analysis, diagnostics, and regular medical check-ups.\n\t\nChildhood Cancer\t\n249\n", "diagnosis highly influences their ability to fight progression \nof the disease. Understanding the tumor histology, or the \ntypes of cells in the tumor tissue, allows the pathologist \nto identify the type of cancer and predict factors such as \nrapid division of the cancer cells and responsiveness to \nchemotherapeutic agents. The tumor cells\u2019 mitotic index \nis the percentage of tumor cells currently in the process of \ndivision: The more that are dividing, the better they will \nrespond to chemotherapy. Their differentiation indicates \nhow closely the tumor cell resembles its mother cell: The \nmore the tumor cell looks like the original cell, the better. \nA highly differentiated cell is very similar to its sister cell; \nin other words, the more differentiated it is, the more simi\u00ad\nlar the cancer cell is to the other cancer cells. In general, \nmore-similar cancer cells grow and spread more slowly \nand are more responsive to treatment. Lastly, the tumor \nburden (i.e., the number of cancer cells, the tumor size, \nor the amount of cancer in the body) is important. If the \nchild\u2019s tumor is large, and is spread throughout the child\u2019s \nbody, the more difficult the tumor is to treat.\nChemotherapy treatment typically proceeds through \nfour phases. Nevertheless, each oncology diagnosis will \nhave a unique treatment plan and may or may not include \nthese four phases:\n\u2022\t Induction: The first phase of chemotherapy given \nto a child after initial diagnosis to \u201cinduce\u201d a \nMedical Treatments for Childhood Cancer\nAfter determining the cancer diagnosis and the staging \n(Table 18-1), if appropriate, childhood cancers are treated \nwith well-established standard therapies and in clinical trials. \nGuidelines produced by consortia such as the Children\u2019s \nOncology Group and the National Comprehensive Cancer \nNetwork (NCCN) offer the interdisciplinary \u00adoncology \nhealthcare team a roadmap specifically created for the treat\u00ad\nment of a certain cancer\u2014one that is sometimes tailored \nto specific patient populations.\nFor instance, the COG guideline for ALL provides a plan \nof care for girls that lasts 2 years, while the plan of care for \nboys lasts 3 years. The guideline identifies the minimally \nacceptable complete blood count (CBC) laboratory find\u00ad\nings representing bone health (e.g., the number of platelets \nmust be equal to or more than 75,000, and the absolute \nneutrophil count must be equal to or more than 750, prior to \ngiving chemotherapy that causes further decreases in bone \nmarrow hematopoietic cell production). Approximately 7 \nto 10 days after a child receives a course of chemotherapy, \nthe antineoplastic drugs suppress the production of all \nthree cell lines (red blood cells [RBCs], neutrophils, and \nthrombocytes) to their lowest level (nadir). This leaves the \nchild at risk for severe anemia, bleeding, and infection risk.\nChildren\u2019s responses to medical treatment of their \ncancer depends on four principles. The extent of disease at \nTABLE 18-1\u2003\nStaging of Childhood Cancer\nStaging a child\u2019s cancer gives information about treatment plans. Typically, TNM (tumor size, lymph node involvement, and \npresence of metastasis) staging is used for solid childhood tumors. Staging may also include specifics on the location of the \ntumor, the cell type, and the structures involved.\nT: Tumor Size\nAt diagnosis, the child may have one or several small or large tumors present. The size of the tumor(s) helps to determine how \nextensive the cancer diagnosis is. For some larger tumors, surgical debulking may be required to reduce the tumor burden \nbefore other therapies are initiated.\nTx = The tumor cannot accurately be sized.\nT0 = The tumor cannot be found.\nT1\u2212T4 = The tumor size is determined; it may be further distinguished by size and surrounding tissue involvement.\nN: Lymph Node Involvement\nNx = Positive lymph nodes cannot be accurately measured.\nN0 = The adjacent or close-by lymph nodes have no cancer cells detectable within them.\nN1\u2212N3 = Nodes surrounding the tumor are positive; denotes the number of lymph nodes involved.\nM: Presence or Absence of Metastasis\nMx = The presence of metastasis cannot be measured.\nM0 = There is no evidence of local, regional, or widespread metastasis of the original tumor cells.\nM1 = Metastasis (distant growth of tumor cells) has been detected.\n250\t\nCHAPTER 18\u2003 Cellular Regulation\n", "\u25c6\u25c6Vinblastine (M)\n\u25c6\u25c6Paclitaxel (G2 and M)\n\u2022\t Antimetabolites (inhibit protein synthesis)\n\u25c6\u25c6Hydroxyurea (S)\n\u25c6\u25c6Methotrexate (S)\n\u25c6\u25c66-Mercaptopurine (6MP) (S)\n\u25c6\u25c66-Thioguanine (6TG) (S)\n\u25c6\u25c6Cytarabine (S)\nCell-cycle-nonspecific agents include the following \ntherapies:\n\u2022\t Antitumor antibiotics such as daunomycin and \ndactinomycin\n\u2022\t Alkylating agents such as thiotepa and \ncyclophosphamide\n\u2022\t Asparaginase such as l-asparaginase and \nPEG-l-asparaginase\n\u2022\t Nitrosoureas such as carmustine\n\u2022\t Topoisomerase-1 inhibitors such as irinotecan\n\u2022\t Heavy metals such as carboplatin and cisplatin\nAll types of chemotherapy agents cause bone marrow \ntoxicity and a subsequent nadir, requiring specialized \nprotective nursing care.\nremission.

For instance, in treatment of childhood leu\u00ad\nkemia, the maintenance phase can last one or two \nyears and includes weekly IV push therapy with \nvincristine and oral chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy is considered the gold standard of cancer \ntreatment. Very few childhood cancer diagnoses are treated \nwith radiation or surgery alone. Cancer chemotherapy \nuses highly cytotoxic drugs that inhibit the process of cell \ndivision; some of them specifically target cells that divide \nrapidly, which is a characteristic of many (but not all) \ncancer cells (Mitchison, 2012). Because the medication \ncannot distinguish between normal and cancerous cells, \nit also affects normal cells that reproduce rapidly, includ\u00ad\ning blood cells/bone marrow, hair, and gut mucosal cells. \nFor this reason, patients on cancer chemotherapy often \nexperience short-term toxicities and side effects such as \nnausea, alopecia (hair loss), mucositis, pancytopenia, and \nother problems associated with cell damage. In addition, \nlong-term consequences from chemotherapy may include \nlearning disabilities and cognitive effects.\nEach neoplastic drug is considered either cell cycle specific \nor cell cycle nonspecific (i.e., specific or not specific for the \nmitosis cycle). The cell cycle is the multiple-step process \nthat a cell goes through to divide (Figure 18-3). The first \nstage of mitosis is interphase, when the cell is not dividing \nbut is preparing to divide. During this phase of the cell \ncycle, the cell is identified as being in either G1 (centriole \nreplication), S (DNA replication of all 46 chromosomes), \nor G2 (growth). In the next phase, known as the M phase, \nthe cell divides in five distinct steps: prophase, metaphase, \nanaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. In cytokinesis, two \nidentical cells are produced. Chemotherapy may either \ndisrupt cellular division during the cell cycle, or disrupt \nthe cell regardless of which mitotic phase it is in.\nCell-cycle-specific agents include the following therapies:\n\u2022\t Plant alkaloids (inhibit mitosis)\n\u25c6\u25c6Etoposide (G2)\n\u25c6\u25c6Vincristine (M)\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nTypes of Childhood Cancer Treatments\nEight types of treatments are used for childhood cancer:\n\u2022\t Chemotherapy: Antineoplastic drugs administered \nintravenously, intrathecally, intramuscularly, and intra\u00ad\ncavitary that work by inhibiting cellular growth and \ndivision.\n\u2022\t Surgery: Surgical debulking or tumor removal.

The remainder of this \nsection gives an overview of the diagnosis and treatment \nfor more commonly seen pediatric cancers.\nHematologic Cancers\nAcute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nCancer that begins in the bone marrow and is found \nthroughout the child\u2019s blood is called acute lymphoid \nleukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL); it is the \nmost common of all childhood cancers (National Cancer \nInstitute, 2016b). The overall 5-year survival rate for ALL \nis more than 90% (National Cancer Institute, 2016b).\n\t\nChildhood Cancer\t\n253\n", "this disease present in the child\u2019s upper body, such as in the \nchest, in the neck, or behind the breastbone. After staging \nthe tumor, a pediatric oncologist will treat the tumor(s) with \nchemotherapy, or with radiation for more advanced disease.\nCentral Nervous System Tumors\nStarting in the brain or spinal cord, central nervous system \n(CNS) tumors can be either benign (noncancerous) or \nmalignant (cancerous). Unfortunately, even a benign CNS \ntumor is still potentially extremely harmful: Even though \nit does not metastasize, it can have highly detrimental ef\u00ad\nfects on the local brain and nerve tissue. Depending on its \nlocation, a benign tumor can affect a child\u2019s vital functions, \nmemory, thoughts, emotions, and sensory experiences; thus, \nchildren with these types of tumors can have significant \ndisabilities (Figure 18-6).\nDuring the developmental period, children generally \npresent with one of five types of CNS tumors: astrocytoma, \ngerm cell tumor, medulloblastoma, brain stem glioma, or \nependymoma. Treatment can include surgery, radiation, \nchemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. Most \nchildren with tumors in the brain will need care from a \nteam consisting of specialists in both pediatric oncology \nand pediatric neurology, as both the disease and its treat\u00ad\nment present many challenges for the family and the child\u2019s \nlong-term functioning. Many families consider entering \ntheir children into clinical trials when making their treat\u00ad\nment decisions.\nNeuroblastoma\nNeuroblastoma is a CNS cancer that arises from the \nbranches of nerves that run out of or exit from the spinal \ncord. Most young children with neuroblastoma present \nwith tumors in their abdominal cavities. Classic signs of \nthis childhood tumor include a large, bloated abdomen, \nIn this disease, tiny blasts (i.e., immature cancerous \nwhite blood cells) infiltrate and fill the child\u2019s bone mar\u00ad\nrow in great numbers. This infiltration prevents the bone \nmarrow from producing normal cells. With time, blast \ncells will also infiltrate the child\u2019s ovaries, testes, lymph \nnodes, and spinal fluid, and then move to organs such as \nthe spleen, liver, and skin. A child who presents as quite \nill with positive blasts in the CBC blood smear should un\u00ad\ndergo further evaluation, including immunophenotyping \nto determine which proteins are expressed on the tumor \ncell membrane. This information about the cancer cell\u2019s \ngenetics allows the oncologist to determine the expected \nresponse to treatment, and determine whether the child \nis considered a low risk, medium risk, or high risk. Many \nmore factors influence this picture, but early determina\u00ad\ntion of the ALL blast properties can help the oncologist \ndetermine the best course of action (Pui, Mullighan, Evans, \n& Relling, 2012).\nTreatment of ALL consists of inserting a central line \nfor safe drug therapy and rapidly initiating chemotherapy \ndrugs. Chemotherapy guidelines for ALL may include the \nadministration of the medications into both the blood and \nthe intrathecal space to maximize killing of ALL cancer cells \ndwelling in the child\u2019s cerebral spinal fluid. Some children \nwith ALL are eligible for a stem cell and/or bone marrow \ntransplantation (Saletta, Seng, & Lau, 2014).\nAcute Myeloid Leukemia\nCompared to ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML; also \ncalled acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or acute myelogenous \nleukemia) is a less common type of leukemia that is more \ndifficult to treat and more challenging to achieve a remis\u00ad\nsion (Saletta et\u00a0al., 2014). As in ALL, blasts fill the bone \nmarrow spaces and then build up in significant numbers \nwithin the blood circulation in children with AML. When \nthe AML cells enter into organs and form solid tumors, \nthe resulting groupings of cells are called chloroma. Chil\u00ad\ndren who demonstrate AML cellular genetic material that \nplaces them at high risk are considered candidates for bone \nmarrow transplantation. In some high-risk children with \nAML, stem cell transplantation may be warranted to either \nprovide new bone marrow stem cells or assist in a more \nrapid recovery after multidrug high-dose chemotherapy \ntreatment (Leung et\u00a0al., 2012).\nHodgkin Lymphoma\nThe body\u2019s lymphatic system is made up of tiny thin tubes \nwhere clear lymphatic fluid carries lymphocytes. Hodgkin \nlymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system in which \nabnormal lymphatic cells proliferate and form tumors. \nTwo main types of Hodgkin lymphoma are distinguished: \nnodular and classical.

Because this form \nof cancer is relatively rare, referral to pediatric oncology \nspecialists with experience in treating Wilms\u2019 tumor and/\nor a clinical trial is recommended by the National Cancer \nInstitute (2016c).\nRetinoblastoma\nTypically first identified by a child\u2019s parents, a retinoblas\u00ad\ntoma is a tumor located on or within the retina of the eye. \nCommonly, a parent or caregiver will notice an abnormal \nwhitish glow on the child\u2019s retina when light falls on the \neye in a particular angle\u2014a phenomenon called \u00adleukocoria \n(Figure 18-7). Retinoblastomas are rare in children, but \nmore than 40% of all cases have a genetic link. If the tu\u00ad\nmor is localized without metastasis, there is currently a \n90% cure rate.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma includes enucleation \n(removal) of the affected eye, followed by the introduction \nof a custom-made prosthesis. Cryotherapy (use of liquid \nnitrogen), radiation, and laser therapy may be required \nto eliminate remaining cells. The goal of therapy is medi\u00ad\ncal treatment of the cancer and the prevention of visual \nimpairment or blindness.\nNursing Care of the Pediatric Patient \nwith Cancer\nPediatric oncology nursing is a specialized field of nurs\u00ad\ning science. Cancer treatments must be administered by a \nchemotherapy- or biotherapy-certified RN who has shown \nnot only a commitment to this vulnerable population, but \nalso mastery of the necessary knowledge, theory, and safe \nbone pain, refusal to walk, skin tumors, loss of appetite, \nand, if tumors are present in the local area, bowel or bladder \nabnormalities. Most neuroblastomas are found in children \nyounger than age 5; in rare cases, an infant may be born \nwith this type of tumor.\nSurgery to remove the tumor or reduce its bulk, che\u00ad\nmotherapy, radiation, and retinoic acid (Retin-A) are all \nused to treat neuroblastomas. Retinoic acid, a form of \nvitamin A, has been shown to be effective in reducing the \nchance that the child\u2019s tumor will return (relapse) and is \nadministered after standard treatment is complete (Park, \nEggert, & Caron, 2010; Peinemann, van Dalen, Kahangire, \n& Berthold, 2015).\nSoft-Tissue and Bone Cancers\nEwing Sarcoma\nOne type of cancer that affects both bones and nearby \nsoft tissues is the so-called Ewing tumors. Three types \nof Ewing tumors are distinguished: (1) undifferentiated \nEwing sarcoma, which occurs most often; (2) peripheral \nprimitive neuroectodermal (PNET); and (3) extraosseous \nEwing sarcoma. Ewing tumors occur most commonly in \nadolescence (Saletta et\u00a0al., 2014). Treatment of this type \nof neoplasm is determined by the location and size of \nthe tumor, and by whether the tumor has metastasized \nto distant sites. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and \nbone marrow transplantation are all used to treat Ewing \nsarcoma in children.\nWilms\u2019 Tumor (Nephroblastoma)\nCancer of the kidneys accounts for approximately 7% \nof all childhood cancers, and in children younger than \nage 15, most of these cases involve Wilms\u2019 tumors. The \nmean age of diagnosis with these nephroblastomas is 3 to \n4 years. Approximately 10% of the children who develop \nthis cancer have congenital deformities. In addition, \nnumerous specific genetic mutations have been identi\u00ad\nfied for Wilms\u2019 tumor, leading to the recommendation \nthat a referral for genetic counseling be offered under \ncertain circumstances when Wilms\u2019 tumor is diagnosed \n(National Cancer Institute, 2016c). Conditions that should \nraise suspicion of a genetic anomaly include aniridia, \ndevelopmental delay, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, pseu\u00ad\ndohermaphrodism, overgrowth, and hemihyperplasia. A \nchild who is diagnosed with Wilms\u2019 tumor and who has \none or more of these conditions should be assessed for \ngenetic abnormalities. In most children, only one kidney \nis affected, but bilateral tumors are sometimes found, \nalbeit more often in girls than in boys.\nChildren presenting with Wilms\u2019 tumor may by asymp\u00ad\ntomatic, or they may have symptoms such as abdominal \nFigure 18-7\u2002 A child with leukocoria.\nCourtesy of National Cancer Institute (http://www.cancer.gov)\n\t\nNursing Care of the Pediatric Patient with Cancer\t\n255\n", "Figure 18-8\u2002 A child with alopecia from cancer treatment. \nCourtesy of Bill Branson/National Cancer Institute.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nEvidence of Infection in Children Undergoing \nCancer Therapy\nIn children receiving cancer therapy that causes pancytopenia, \nclassic evidence of infection may be absent. Owing to their \ndepressed bone marrow function and subsequent reduced \nproduction of granulocytes (both mature, segmented neutro\u00ad\nphils that can fight infection and immature new granulocytes \nknown as bands), these children may not have any of the \ncells that would normally cause a cell-mediated reaction at \nthe infection site. For instance, in a child with cancer who \nis receiving chemotherapy and is now in nadir, and who \nhas a central line insertion site infection, there may not be \nany redness, swelling, pain, or pus at the line insertion site \nbecause there are no neutrophils to respond to the infection. \nLymphocytes may be severely reduced to the point of not \nbeing able to launch a T-cell killer infection-fighting presence. \nThe ANC can be very low, critically low, or actually zero in \nchildren with cancer, in which case the child may be highly \nvulnerable to infection yet not produce clear symptoms by \nwhich to identify an infection.

The Association of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology \nNurses (APHON) provides written support materials to \nprepare nurses for the national certification exam.\nPediatric nurses working in schools, clinics, and emer\u00ad\ngency rooms must be prepared to identify a child with \ncancer who is in trouble; one with the potential for serious \nside effects such as anemia, dehydration, and neutropenia \nwith fevers (sepsis is a life-threatening complication); and \none who needs care of a central line or implanted port. All \nnurses must have basic knowledge related to caring for a \nchild with cancer and should be able to assess a child for \nsevere symptoms such as pain and nausea using develop\u00ad\nmentally appropriate subjective and objective assessment \ntools, symptoms of stomatitis (mouth sores) or mucositis \n(mucous membrane sores anywhere in the body), anemia, \nevidence of bleeding and petechiae, neutropenia, and pend\u00ad\ning sepsis (Figure 18-8). In addition, all nurses should be \nable to assess a central line for complications or a port site \nfor subtle evidence of infection.\nEducating families during cancer treatment is an on\u00ad\ngoing responsibility of the pediatric nurse. Teaching and \nthen reinforcing emotionally difficult and complex topics \nto families who have diversity in language, culture, health \nliteracy, and desire to learn is quite challenging. From \ndiagnosis of childhood cancer, through the phases of in\u00ad\nduction, consolidation, intensification, and maintenance \nthrough long-term follow-up (surveillance), there is much \nthat the family needs to understand and decision making \nin which they need to participate. Communication is key \nin keeping a child with cancer safe. Families must feel as if \nthey can readily contact the pediatric oncology care team \nto report clinical changes, concerns about the child\u2019s condi\u00ad\ntion, fevers, symptoms, and side effects. Cancer is highly \ndisruptive to the flow of family life, and stress, financial \nstrain, marital problems, and sibling rivalry are just a few \nof the challenges that families may face. Mobilizing support \nsystems to assist the family is a powerfully important role \nof the pediatric nurse.

Th actual numbers of children exposed to cancer \ntreatment who have long-term effects are low, but this risk is \ninfluenced by the extent of the tumor, the child\u2019s gender, the \nage during treatment, and the type of treatment administered. \nLearning disabilities (cognitive effects), delayed cognitive \ndevelopment, delayed physical development, infertility, and \nemotional outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder, \ndepression, and mood disorders have all been documented \nto influence the quality of life and well-being of childhood \ncancer survivors. Some of these effects have been found to \nbe present within weeks of treatment, whereas others may \nsurface years later.\nAcademic success is highly important to a child\u2019s immedi\u00ad\nate life and long-term success and independence. Long-term \neffects of cancer therapy may include problems with attention \nspan, mathematics, spelling, information processing, organiza\u00ad\ntion, and reading comprehension. Pediatric oncology nurses \nand other nurses who encounter survivors who are struggling \nin these areas should encourage the family to get learning \ndisability testing for the child.\nMetabolic disorders such as long-term hypothyroidism, \ngrowth hormone deficiency, and osteoporosis need close \nmedical screening and adequate follow-up care.

This life-threatening \nemergency requires rapid reporting and initiation of antibiotics. \nThe child should go directly to the emergency department or \npediatric floor for blood cultures, which are typically followed \nby administration of a cephalosporin, an aminoglycoside, and, \nif needed, an IV course of antifungals/antibiotics.\nHematologic Disorders\nDisorders related to the hematologic system include genetic \ndisorders, acquired disorders, nutrition-related disorders, \nand situational conditions such as hemorrhage.

If \na school-age child or teen claims to follow a vegetarian/\nvegan or \u201cspecial\u201d diet, whether the rationale is for weight \nloss or moral justifications, the child and caregivers should \nbe given appropriate feedback on the need for supporting \nintake of iron and B vitamins to avoid both iron-deficiency \nand pernicious anemia (Grooms et\u00a0al., 2013). Anemia may \noccur secondary to eating disorders, but in a child with \nnormal weight who claims a standard diet but nonethe\u00ad\nless presents with pernicious anemia, the possibility of a \nmalabsorption syndrome (e.g., celiac disease) should be \nconsidered (Hoffman et\u00a0al., 2013).\nMedical Treatment for Anemia\nThe pediatric healthcare team will determine the severity \nof the child\u2019s presenting anemia. A long course of oral iron \nsupplementation may be sufficient if the parents make \ndietary changes to stop the progression of the child\u2019s state \nof anemia. In more severe cases, the child may be hospital\u00ad\nized for intravenous iron dextrose solutions and possibly \npacked red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion.\nAdditional laboratory evaluations may include a direct \nCoombs test (which assesses for the presence of antibodies \ncausing the child to experience hemolysis), serum iron, \ntransferrin, osmotic fragility for spherocytosis, lead levels, \nand hemoglobin electrophoresis to allow the determination \nof which type of hemoglobinopathy is present.\nAnemia Therapy: Transfusion\nChildren who have a hematologic condition that requires \nan immediate intervention for anemia will be given a \nPRBC transfusion, in which the vast majority of serum \nand white blood cells are removed, leaving RBCs behind. \nMinute quantities of donor serum and white blood cells are \nthe source of most transfusion reactions. Other transfused \nblood products are listed in Table 18-2.\nNursing Care of a Child Receiving a Transfusion\nChildren receiving transfusions require specialized care. \nThe pediatric nurse must provide developmentally appro\u00ad\npriate nursing care to such a child. Eliciting the support \nand engagement of the Child Life team will assist the child \nin understanding why the transfusion is needed and what \nthe child can expect.\nSafety must be maintained during the transfusion.

Acquired disorders \nare associated with changes in the RBCs that occur with \nsome infectious diseases, such as parvovirus infection \ncausing aplastic disorders or malaria.\nAnemia\nDefined as a condition or disease that significantly reduces \neither the total measurable circulating RBC count or the \namount of hemoglobin, anemia strains the child\u2019s body by \nreducing the availability of oxygen. Healthy hemoglobin \nprovides all cells with the needed amounts of oxygen. The \nprocesses of growth, tissue repair, mental capacity, and \nenergy production all require adequate oxygen. Anemia \ninterrupts the delivery of oxygen in one of five ways:\n\u2022\t Impaired production of RBCs or impaired produc\u00ad\ntion of hemoglobin\n\u2022\t Disturbances in the metabolic pathways, such as \nnutritional disorders, conditions, or deficiencies\n\u2022\t Decreased production or efficacy of erythropoietin, \nthe renal hormone\n\u2022\t Small prolonged bleeds, occult GI bleeds, or \nfrank hemorrhage leading to a reduced level of \nhematocrit\n\u2022\t Conditions of hemolysis or destruction in \nwhich \u00adeither antibodies destroy RBCs or tox\u00ad\nins, \u00adchemicals, parasites, and microbes destroy \n\u00adcirculating RBCs\nNutrition-related anemia is the most common anemia in \nthe infant, toddler, and preschool stage, and often is associ\u00ad\nated with over-consumption of milk (Lundblad, Rosenberg, \nMangurten, & Angst, 2016; Ziegler, 2011). A young child \nwho consistently consumes more than 24\u00a0ounces of milk \nper day is at risk for not consuming foods rich in iron and \ncomplete proteins, which in turn increases the child\u2019s risk \nof developing anemia. An infant who is given cow\u2019s milk \nbefore the first birthday may experience irritation of the \nGI mucosa leading to occult bleeds, which can further \ndeplete iron stores.\nChildren with anemia will present with classic symp\u00ad\ntoms including fatigue, irritability, pallor, dizziness, and \ndyspnea. If the child is experiencing active bleeding, the \nnurse may observe vomiting, diarrhea, and melena (blood \nin the stools). If the child is actively bleeding in the genito\u00ad\nurinary system, hematuria may be present. In severe cases, \nthe child\u2019s symptoms can progress to severe syncope, poor \nconcentration, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, \nand death. Any child who presents with symptoms of \nanemia should have an immediate CBC and reticulocyte \nanalysis performed, along with a diet history and physi\u00ad\ncal examination.

ABO and \nRh compatibility must be matched.\nPacked Red Blood Cells (PRBC)\nGiven when a child\u2019s hemoglobin or hematocrit is low (typically 8 g/dL or less) and the child is symptomatic. For children, \nPRBC transfusions are given in a dose of 10\u221215 mL/kg from one donor if possible. A single unit of donor PRBCs can be divided \ninto alloquots (4 packs) so the blood can be preserved for future transfusions. Limiting a child\u2019s exposure to transfused foreign \nproteins is essential to prevent alloimmunization (i.e., the production of antibodies against transfused cells). One transfusion \ndose of PRBCs typically raises a child\u2019s hemoglobin by 1 g/dL and the hematocrit by 3%.\nPlatelets\nSmall particles of the cell walls from the thrombocytes, which are essential for the production of clots. Many children who \nexperience pancytopenia from cancer treatment will require lifesaving platelet transfusions. If a child\u2019s count is 20,000 or fewer \ncells and there is evidence of bleeding, the child will need a platelet transfusion. A cross-match is typically performed between \nthe donor and the recipient, but is not required. ABO and Rh compatibility between the donor and the recipient is preferred to \nreduce alloimmunization.\nFresh-Frozen Plasma\nAdministered to a child to increase coagulation factors: factor IX (stable) or factor V and factor IX (unstable). Fresh-frozen plasma \nmay be given to patients with traumatic injuries and children with significant burns.\nGranulocyte Infusions\nAssociated with a very high risk of severe incompatibility reactions.

The child should have designated \nvital signs equipment set up next to the bed so that rapid \nmeasurements can be taken as needed and per protocol. All \nblood products must be double-checked by two registered \nnurses at the bedside, with the child\u2019s identification also \nbeing verified. Documentation of the double-checking \nsafety procedures is imperative.\nBlood product transfusions are not without risks. Children \nwho will receive transfusion therapy must have all risks and \nbenefits described to the family, and written consent must \nbe obtained unless the child is being transfused after a life-\nthreatening injury within emergency services. Transfusion \nreactions, if they are going to occur, typically become evident \nwithin the first 5 to 15 minutes after the transfusion being \nadministered (see also Box 18-1 for examples of painful \ntransfusions). Medications to treat transfusion reactions \nshould be made available, but not necessarily drawn up. \nThese medications include antipyretics, antihistamines, \nepinephrine, corticosteroids, and bags of 0.9% NS for rapid \nfluid resuscitation if the child\u2019s blood pressure falls.\nThe following conditions may lead to pain during a transfusion:\n\u2022\t Iron overload, which requires chelation therapy (he\u00ad\nmochromatosis) to reduce the risk of liver, heart, and \ntissue damage.\n\u2022\t Graft-versus-host disease, in which transfused blood \nproducts attack bone marrow cells, leading to fevers, \nrash, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and increased liver \nfunction tests.

A child who has \nthis kind of reaction will need to have subsequent \ntransfusions of HLA-matched blood to lower the \nquantity of antibodies transfused.\nAnaphylaxis\n\u2022\t A severe and rapid reaction to the transfused \nproduct, which leads to an overwhelming immune \nresponse.\n\u2022\t Call the rapid response team immediately, \nand bring the crash cart to the room. Stop the \ntransfusion and start a 0.9% NS line on new \ntubing. Begin NS IV boluses. Prepare lifesaving \nmedications such as epinephrine, antihistamines, \nsteroids, and vasopressors. Save all transfusion \nequipment and the transfused blood bag for \nlaboratory analysis. Be prepared to draw blood for \nlaboratory analysis as ordered. Transfer the child to \na higher level of care (PICU).\nSickle Cell Anemia\nChildren with an autosomal recessive congenital (genetic) \ndisorder of hemoglobin leading to rigid sickle-shaped RBCs \nare diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD). Fetuses and \nyoung infants have highly efficient hemoglobin F (fetal), \nwhich is subsequently replaced with hemoglobin A (adult). \nThrough newborn screening for inborn errors of metabo\u00ad\nlism, infants may be identified early with the life-changing \ncondition of hemoglobin S (sickle), and prevention of \ncomplications can start early.\nSickle cell disease is predominately found in the \n\u00adAfrican American community and has an incidence \nrate of \u00adapproximately 1 case per 500 live births. Most \nchildren with SCD are symptomatic by middle infancy. \nEarly diagnosis is made through hemoglobin electropho\u00ad\nresis, which determines the types of hemoglobin present. \nChildren with SCD are monitored by their sickle cell \nindex (sickled solubility), a measure of the percentage \nof circulating sickled cells. An increasing percentage \nindicates that the affected cells are becoming grouped \ntogether in the small vasculature, which can lead to \ntissue hypoxia and eventually ischemia. The presence \nof abnormal sickle S hemoglobin (HgbS) in SCD leads \nto vaso-occlusive states described as vaso-occlusive \nepisodes. In these events, the child experiences both \nchronic pain and acute peaks of pain, requiring drug \ntherapy. Significant hemolytic anemia occurs due to the \nfragility of the sickled cells. Cellular waste products build \nup in the spleen, and the child is at risk for needing a \nsplenectomy before rupture occurs.\nA vaso-occlusive episode begins with a trigger. For \nexample, a state of hypoxia, hypoxemia, infection, \u00adfatigue, \n262\t\nCHAPTER 18\u2003 Cellular Regulation\n", "TABLE 18-3\u2003\nMedications and Other Interventions for Sickle Cell Disease\nMedications\n\u203a\u203a\nProphylaxis for infection prevention: daily oral penicillin or amoxicillin\n\u203a\u203a\nPulmonary inhalers such as albuterol to dilate the bronchus and bronchioles and improve lung function\n\u203a\u203a\nVitamin D and calcium for reduced serum levels\n\u203a\u203a\nHydroxyurea to increase hemoglobin F production\n\u203a\u203a\nGabapentin for inflammation associated with sickled clots and pain\n\u203a\u203a\nAspirin, if indicated, for coagulation prevention\n\u203a\u203a\nFolic acid to increase the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the RBCs\n\u203a\u203a\nAntibiotic therapy if the presenting trigger is infection\n\u203a\u203a\nDeferoximine (Desferal) or deferasirox (Jadenu) to remove increased levels of iron from transfusion therapy and hemolysis\n\u203a\u203a\nPain medications: Motrin, Tylenol with Codeine, Vicodin, Norco, and morphine as needed\n\u203a\u203a\nPatient-controlled analgesia (PCA) if the child is hospitalized for a pain crisis or vaso-occlusive episode and needs intravenous \nfluids and intravenous pain management: usually morphine or Dilaudid\n\u203a\u203a\nIntranasal Fentanyl for rapid pain management in emergency room settings\nOther Interventions\n\u203a\u203a\nOxygen therapy if the child presents with abnormal arterial or capillary blood gases or low oxygen saturations\n\u203a\u203a\nIntravenous fluid resuscitation if the child presents with dehydration, increased percentage of sickle cells, and vaso-occlusion\n\u203a\u203a\nWarm packs on areas of vaso-occlusion for pain and increased circulation to the affected areas\n\u203a\u203a\nBlood transfusion therapy if the child is severely anemic and in hemolysis\n\u203a\u203a\nRest to improve healing\n\u203a\u203a\nNutrition for tissue repair and cell production\n\u203a\u203a\nCounseling for stress reduction and improved coping\npainful exacerbations and vaso-occlusive episodes renders \nthese special children vulnerable to emotional distress.\nChildren with SCD face the prospect of recurring acute \nepisodes of pain. This pain is directly related to the occlu\u00ad\nsion of small vessels, which become clogged with sickled \n(banana-shaped) red blood cells. The clogged vessels then \nbecome inflamed, which draws neutrophils to the area, \nand blood flow in the area becomes static. This process \nleads to tissue hypoxia, acidosis, and eventually ischemia. \nInflammation also damages the vascular endothelium. Pain \ncan be found in a variety of areas of the body (Table 18-4). \nDuring these painful episodes, the nurse must perform \naccurate subjective and objective pain assessments, to be \nfollowed with effective pain management.\nThe pediatric nurse working with this population must \nunderstand the pathology of SCD, know how to identify it, \nand prevent exposure to and reduce triggers in the child\u2019s \nlife. Education is paramount for the child and family. Pro\u00ad\nviding rapid interventions for vaso-occlusive episodes and \nunderstanding how to effectively assess and manage pain \nprovides safety for the child, prevents complications, and \nTABLE 18-4\u2003\nAreas of Sickle Cell Disease\u2013Related Pain: Vaso-\nocclusion, Hypoxia, and Ischemia of Tissues\nDactylitis: acute pain and swelling of the fingers\nOsteomyelitis: inflammation of bone tissue \nArthritis: inflammation of the joints\nPriapism: prolonged and painful erections due to the \npresence of viscous blood/clots in the penis; these clots may \nrequire extraction or vasodilation via medications\nPneumonia: inflammation and infection of the pulmonary \nsystem, which can precede acute chest syndrome\nSplenic sequestration: pooling of RBCs and hemolyzed RBC \ncomponents\nCholecystitis: inflammation and infection of the gallbladder, \nnecessitating removal of this organ\nAcute chest syndrome: a severe life-threatening condition in \nwhich microscopic clots form in the pulmonary vasculature, \naffecting ventilation and gas exchange\n\t\nHematologic Disorders\t\n263\n", "QUALITY AND SAFETY\nC\nhildren who are hospitalized with sickle cell anemia and \nrequire a surgical intervention should not be given a \nprolonged course of preoperative or postoperative oxygen \ntherapy.

Working closely with the interdisciplinary \nteam to implement management of the child\u2019s care may \nmean that the pediatric nurse takes the primary role in \nensuring effective communication between the family and \nthe healthcare team. All children with SCD need a case \nmanagement approach to care and continued education \nthroughout the developmental period.\nComplications of SCD are associated with the various \ntypes of the disease. When children are diagnosed with \nHbSS (i.e., with two copies of the sickle gene), they have a \ngreater chance of experiencing acute complications such \nas pain crises, bacteremia, aplastic crisis, and acute chest \nsyndrome. Early identification of signs and symptoms of \nthese complications can reduce the need for prolonged \nhospitalization, severe injury, and death. Monitoring for \nsigns of complications includes observing verbal indications \nof increasing pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, \nand inconsolability in young children. Pain may or may \nnot be associated with a vaso-occlusive episode.\nFactor Deficiencies\nSome children may present with an X-linked recessive \nbleeding disorder requiring factor replacement. Hemophilia \nis one such disorder; in fact, it is the most common severe \ninherited coagulation disorder. Hemophilia A (factor VIII \ndeficiency; occurs more often in boys) and hemophilia \nB (factor IX deficiency) are the most common forms of \nhemophilia. Patients with hemophilia are cared for the \npediatric hematology oncology team. In such children, \nthe pediatric nurse must be able to provide rapid assess\u00ad\nments for evidence of bleeding, both frank and occult, and \nbe skilled at the administration of and education about \nintravenous factor replacement.\nInfants may be first diagnosed with hemophilia when \nthey display bleeding episodes during or after a circumci\u00ad\nsion, venipuncture, or a surgical intervention. The severity \nof the disorder (mild, moderate, severe) is graded based on \nthe percentage of factor produced by the child. Absence of \neither factor VIII or factor IX leads to severe impairment of \nthrombin and fibrin generation. Classic clinical presenta\u00ad\ntions are bruising (ecchymotic areas on the skin), bleeding \ngums, hematuria, epistaxis (nosebleeds), joint pain from \nbleeds into joints (synovitis and hemiarthrosis), bleed\u00ad\ning with rigorous play leading to injuries, and significant \nbleeds with trauma.\nActive bleeding requires immediate venous access for \nIV factor replacement. Children may require administra\u00ad\ntion of 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) to \nincrease their factor VIII level prior to a surgical procedure \nsuch as wisdom teeth extraction.\nCase Study\nMarisol, a 16-year-old Hispanic girl, has been in the PICU for \nsevere pancreatitis for over a week. She originally presented to \nthe pediatric emergency department with severe abdominal \npain, elevated temperature, nausea, and dyspepsia. Her initial \ndiagnosis was based on her elevated pancreatic enzymes and \nclinical presentation. Her family speaks only Spanish and has \nbeen present at her bedside continuously.\nAs her condition progressed, Marisol developed pan\u00ad\ncytopenia and received a consultation from the pediatric \noncologist. After both serum laboratory analysis and a sub\u00ad\nsequent biopsy of a large lymph node on her neck, Marisol \nwas diagnosed with lymphoma. She was very distressed \nabout the diagnosis and immediately displayed signs of \nwithdrawal, was very concerned about the future and her \nschooling, and appeared depressed. Because Marisol is \nthe family\u2019s \u201cinterpreter,\u201d her parents are not sure what is \nhappening and seem very confused and alarmed by their \ndaughter\u2019s behavior.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t Now that a diagnosis of lymphoma has been verified, \nwhat are the appropriate first steps in a family-centered \nmodel of care for this teen and her family?\n2.\t How is lymphoma treated?\n3.\t Which special care needs arise for a teenager facing \nlengthy treatments with multiple inpatient admissions?\n4.\t Which resources can a nurse mobilize for this patient?\n(continues)\n264\t\nCHAPTER 18\u2003 Cellular Regulation\n", "Case Study\u2002 (continued)\nAs the Case Evolves.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nAfter the initial diagnosis of lymphoma is made, the nurse \nsits down with Marisol and her family. A medical interpreter \nis brought in so that Marisol does not have to interpret for her \nparents. The nurse answers the parents\u2019 initial question\u2014\u201cWhat \nis wrong with our daughter?\u201d\u2014by explaining that Marisol has \nlymphoma and describing what that means.

Children with \ncancer often need to receive multiple antineoplastic \n(chemotherapy) drugs over an extended period of time \nto achieve remission.\n\u25c6\u25c6The cause of childhood cancer is often difficult to \npinpoint because a child has not had a lifetime of \ntoxic exposures (e.g., smoking, drinking, radiation, \nsun exposure, asbestos).

Adverse effects of \u00adanemia\u2014\nmost often related to iron deficiency\u2014not only \nimpact oxygen delivery to tissues, but can also have \nnegative effects on development of cognition and \nacademic and verbal skills in children ranging from \ninfancy to adolescence (Halterman, Kaczorowski, \nAligne, Auinger, & Szilagyi, 2001). Transfusion may \nbe needed in case of inadequate oxygenation.\n\u2022\t Precision: Precisely timed cardiac cycles of contrac\u00ad\ntion and refilling phases are managed by an innate \nsystem of electrical conduction, pacemaking nodes, \nand cardiac muscle fibers located throughout the \nheart. Disruption of conduction can result in ar\u00ad\nrhythmias, which negatively affect perfusion and \noxygenation (Figure 19-2).\n\u2022\t Perfusion: Episodes of low blood pressure can \nlead to poor tissue perfusion (delivery of blood \nto the body\u2019s cells) and shock. Hypotension can \nbe a late sign of compromise in children, so care \nand treatment should be initiated before it occurs. \nThe opposite condition, hypertension, can also \nlead to poor health outcomes in children, simi\u00ad\nlar to those noted in adults, and is thought to be \nunder-diagnosed. Priority goals for the healthcare \nteam related to blood pressure are to prevent hypo\u00ad\ntension and hypertension.\n\u2022\t Protection: When critical illness or fluid loss oc\u00ad\ncurs, a child\u2019s body will recognize this state and \nprotectively reduce blood flow to noncritical areas, \nreserving the bulk of the oxygen delivery for the \nheart and brain. Prompt corrective treatment is \nessential because the child will not be able to com\u00ad\npensate indefinitely; cardiovascular collapse and \ndeath will eventually result from such a condition.\n\u2022\t Homeostasis: Critical to adequate blood pressures \nand perfusion is optimized fluid and electrolyte \nstatus for the child\u2019s specific needs. Fluid overload, \nwhich is sometimes worsened by low urine output, \ncan lead to heart failure. Lack of adequate intra\u00ad\nvascular fluid volume can lead to hypotension and, \npossibly, shock. Sodium, chloride, and potassium \nlevels, along with other blood chemistries, are vital \nto monitor and correct as needed.\n\u2022\t Elimination: Renal function is critical to maintain\u00ad\ning fluid and electrolyte balance, which supports \nIntroduction\nCardiovascular (CV) disease in children occurs either due \nto a congenital heart defect (born with the malformation) \nor acquired heart disease (acquired sometime after birth). \nSuch defects involve the physical structures in the heart \nand can alter heart function, circulatory function, or both. \nCongenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most frequent kind \nof birth defect and are the largest cause of birth defect\u2012\u00ad\nrelated fatalities in the first year of life, affecting nearly 1% \n(approximately 40,000) of babies born in the United States \neach year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n[CDC], 2015). Of the 1% born with CHDs, 25% have a \ncritical congenital heart defect (CCHD) requiring at least \none invasive intervention before the infant reaches his or \nher first birthday. In 2004, hospitalization costs for infants \nwith congenital heart conditions amounted to $1.4 billion \n(CDC, 2015). Higher risk of congenital heart defects can be \nrelated to maternal conditions such as diabetes, smoking, \nand obesity (CDC, 2015; National Center on Birth Defects \nand Developmental Disabilities, 2016).\nThis chapter explores broad categories of congenital \nheart disease and acquired cardiac disease (ACD), along \nwith the nursing care that children with these conditions \nrequire. Congenital conditions predominantly involve struc\u00ad\ntural issues that affect blood flow and, therefore, perfusion. \nAcquired heart conditions can result from a multitude of \netiologies, such as maternal diseases (diabetes), infectious \nprocesses (rheumatic fever), or a combination of factors, \nor as a secondary result from another illness.\nCardiopulmonary System Functioning \nfrom Infancy to Childhood\nCardiopulmonary development begins very early in preg\u00ad\nnancy. Functioning atria, ventricles, valves, and vessels \nare in place at eight weeks into the pregnancy; therefore, \ncongenital malformations occur early in fetal development \nas well (Blackburn, 2003). The fetal circulation supports the \nfetus\u2019s overall growth but directs the majority of the blood \nsupply away from the developing lungs. These shunts, or \nblood flow pathways, persist because of pressure changes \ninside the cardiopulmonary system that force pathways \nto stay propped open or reverse the blood flow, similar to \nwater flowing upstream or pooling behind a dam.\nAfter birth, the circulatory system transitions to the \nnormal, familiar function: circulation of oxygen-carrying \nblood flowing in from the lungs and out to the body, and \nreturn of the deoxygenated blood to the lungs for reoxygen\u00ad\nation.

Conse\u00ad\nquently, precision when measuring output is an important \naspect of pediatric nursing care. Urine outputs no lower \nthan 1 to 2 mL/kg/hr are desired, and those less than \n2 mL/kg/hr should be monitored closely and included in \noverall fluid status assessment, including daily weights. \nTABLE 19-1\u2003\nThree Fetal Shunts and Anticipated Closure\nForamen ovale (flap-like opening between the atria): Directs \nthe majority of blood away from the lungs. This intracardiac \nshunt should close after birth, when blood pressure in the \nlungs decreases (pulmonary vasodilatation) and left-sided \nheart pressure increases.\nDuctus arteriosus (connects the descending aorta and left \npulmonary artery): Diverts the majority of blood away from the \nfetus\u2019s lungs in utero. If this extracardiac shunt persists beyond \nthe neonatal period, it can produce left-to-right (increased \nblood flow to the lungs) shunt-related symptoms. May \nbecome bidirectional in blood flow for a few hours after birth.\nDuctus venosus (connects the umbilical vein to the fetal \ninferior vena cava): Allows for fetal mixed blood to bypass the \nliver. This shunt, which is outside the heart, is permanently \nclosed with clamping of the umbilical cord after birth.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nT\no prevent a devastating premature closure of the duc\u00ad\ntus arteriosus before birth, pregnant women should \nnot take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \nNSAIDs are prostaglandin antagonists and interfere with \nthe continual production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), \nwhich normally keeps the ductus arteriosus patent in \nutero. Closure leads to profound right-sided heart failure \nin the unborn baby (Antonucci et\u00a0al., 2012).\nIn the developing child, the CV features evolve with progres\u00ad\nsion through developmental stages. Gradual shifts in baseline \nvalues of vital signs is a normal part of growth and development. \nProgression from a more rapid heart rate to a less rapid one \nwith increasing age as well as higher-trending blood pressure \nmeasurements are considered part of this evolution and, when \nthey are within the expected ranges, considered normal. The \nheart grows in size at the same rate as body weight increases. \nBlood volume capacity increases from 40 mL in the infant to \n600 to 800 mL in the adult. Just as in adults, heart health can \ngreatly influence how successful the child is at living a healthy \nlifestyle regarding food choices and daily activity. Genetic and \nenvironmental factors also play key roles.\nHealthcare providers should be familiar with the changes \nin the functional cardiovascular system expected at each \ndevelopmental level:\n\u2022\t Newborns (birth to 28 days): The newborn phase is \nthe most rapidly adaptive, featuring the transition \nto air-breathing from maternal/placental oxygen\u00ad\nation. Corresponding changes in the newborn\u2019s \ncirculatory system occur that support perfusion \nthrough the new non-fetal blood flow pathways\u2014\nspecifically, through the closure of the three fetal \nshunts owing to shifts in pulmonary and systemic \npressures (Table 19-1).\nThe newborn and infant myocardium or cardiac muscle \nis relatively stiff. As a consequence, the heart cannot ex\u00ad\npand the volume of blood that fills the chambers to be \nsubsequently pumped and distributed, if such expansion \nis needed to meet increased perfusion demands owing to \nillness, dehydration, or other volume loss such as bleed\u00ad\ning. Instead, the only way to improve cardiac output is by \n270\t\nChapter 19\u2003 Cardiovascular: Perfusion\n", "Causes of Congenital Heart Defects\nSome inherited syndromes can include a CHD, including \nthe following conditions, all of which have strong genetic \ncomponents (Oster et\u00a0al., 2016):\n\u2022\t Chromosomal syndromes: Down syndrome \n\u00ad(trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), \n\u00adPatau syndrome (trisomy 13), and Turner syndrome\n\u2022\t Genetic associations: CHARGE syndrome and \nVATER/VACTERL association\n\u2022\t Chromosomal deletion/microdeletions: DiGeorge \nsyndrome (22q11 deletion) and Williams syndrome\nPositive family history of CHD, particularly in siblings, \nincreases concern for CHD recurrence.

General appearance of small or thin \nstature from poor weight gain, signs of chronic hypoxemia \n(low level of oxygen in the blood) such as clubbed fingers, \nand dysmorphic features are also noted. Physical assess\u00ad\nment includes systematic auscultation of heart sounds for \nmurmurs (noting extra sounds S3 or S4, location, pitch, \ntiming, intensity, quality, duration, and radiation), lung \nsounds, height, weight, vital signs including blood pressure \n(BP) measurements in all four extremities (if BP readings \ndemonstrate different pressures between upper and lower \nextremities, report immediately), and presence and qual\u00ad\nity of the child\u2019s peripheral pulses.

The nurse must assess hydration status, including \nmucous membranes moisture and turgor; skin temperature of \nextremities; mottling; capillary refill time; diaphoresis; urine \noutput; and level of the liver border. An abnormally located \nliver border can indicate fluid overload due to congestive \nheart disease; in such cases, peripheral edema, presence of \ncyanosis or pallor, and signs of fatigue may be observed.\nDiagnostics\nThe pediatric healthcare team has access to an array of \ndiagnostics and tools for assessing children for cardiac ab\u00ad\nnormalities. These tools include chest X-ray to determine \nheart size and position, 12- or 15-lead electrocardiography \n(ECG) to detect arrhythmias, echocardiogram to delineate \nanatomy, and ventricular function test to detect abnormal \nflow. An echocardiogram is a noninvasive tool that can di\u00ad\nagnose cardiac disease with nearly the same accuracy as the \ninvasive, definitively diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Such \ncatheterization is associated with significant risks of injury, \nbleeding, and infection as well as procedural and postop\u00ad\nerative nursing care. This procedure includes cannulation \nof a large vein, usually in the femoral area, to directly view \nstructures, obtain myocardial biopsies, assess conduction, \nand measure cardiac flow and pressures.

If the difference in \nthe two simultaneous readings is greater than 3%, further \ndiagnostic testing for a CCHD is needed.\nPain Effects on Perfusion\nChildren rarely experience the same type of chest pain \nas adults do from ischemia.

De\u00ad\nvelopmentally appropriate pain tools should be used \nin this evaluation. Results from objective pain tools, \nsubjective pain tools, and physiological measurements \nof vital signs should be combined to assess a child\u2019s \ncomplaint of pain. Prompt interventions with appropri\u00ad\nate and adequate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic \nstrategies are critical.\nCare Management of a Child with a CV \nSystem Disorder\nSeveral CV conditions affecting perfusion have lengthy \nand complex management. Some disorders require several \nsurgeries and long-term medical management if the child \nis to attain normal or near-normal cardiovascular function. \nCongenital defects affecting critical blood flow pathways \ndemand immediate corrective surgery. The timing of the \nclosure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) fetal shunt \ncan mean that an infant with an undetected CCHD is sent \nhome and then suffers the risk of acute decompensation \nor dies when the PDA closes. Some CV disorders that \nsignificantly affect perfusion can cause complications in \nthe cardiopulmonary system, such as congestive heart \nfailure, as well as in all organs that are sensitive to reduced \nperfusion. A child with an acute or chronic CV condition \nthat becomes incompatible with life may be a candidate \nfor heart or heart/lung transplantation.\n\t\nCare Management of a Child with a CV System Disorder\t\n273\n", "(right-to-left cardiac blood flow) types, but each child\u2019s \ndefect is unique and the cardiac \u201cshunt\u201d or blood flow can \nchange or reverse itself, depending on the child\u2019s condition, \nleading to symptoms that seem contrary to the acyanotic \nor cyanotic categories. This can complicate assessment and \nclinical decision making. To better understand the underly\u00ad\ning processes that impact blood flow with different defects, \nthe following four concepts can be used to classify CHDs:\n\u2022\t Obstructive defects: can be systemic or, if pulmo\u00ad\nnary, may produce cyanosis\n\u2022\t Decreased pulmonary flow: right-to-left flow and \nlikely to produce cyanosis\n\u2022\t Increased pulmonary flow: left-to-right flow and \nless likely to produce cyanosis\n\u2022\t Mixed defects with oxygenated and deoxygenated \nblood comingling in the heart chambers: likely to \nresult in cyanosis (Rudd & Kocisko, 2014)\nSome patients with CHDs/CCHDs will be \u201cductal de\u00ad\npendent\u201d temporarily. In other words, they depend on the \nductus arteriosus staying open longer than usual to allow \nnecessary blood flow to the lungs if the defects prevent any \nother flow to the lungs once the ductus closes naturally. \nOxygen and lack of maternal prostaglandins are two key \nfactors that cause the closure of the ductus\u2014which is the \nrationale for intentionally using medications (prostaglandin \nE1 [PGE-1]) and accepting lower oxygen saturation ranges \nto keep this pathway open in children who would cease \nto perfuse and oxygenate, until immediate surgical inter\u00ad\nvention can be accomplished. Table 19-2 and Table 19-3 \nidentify some CHDs that are representative of numerous \nmalformation variations.\nA CV disorder can lead the child to suffer social isola\u00ad\ntion, low self-esteem, and poor body image (Luyckx et\u00a0al., \n2014). The pediatric nurse must assess, plan, implement, \nand evaluate interventions to combat these psychosocial \neffects. The primary goal of care for any child with con\u00ad\ngenital or acquired heart disease is to use developmentally \nappropriate care plans and interventions to prevent poor \nperfusion states and optimize cardiovascular function. This \ngoal applies throughout the life span, as survivorship rates \nare improving and more children with CHD/CCHD are \nsurviving into late adolescence and adulthood.\nThe following approach to nursing care will optimize \nsupport for the child with a CV condition:\n\u2022\t Develop a holistic nursing plan of care that includes \nmultidisciplinary participation.\n\u2022\t Offer empathetic care by being sensitive to the pri\u00ad\nvacy needs of the parents and child, providing care \nbreaks to the parents, and facilitating a calm and \nhealing environment.\n\u2022\t Monitor vital signs, lab tests, and diagnostic \nprocedures to detect developing or subclinical \ncomplications.\n\u2022\t Provide efficient care to reduce discomfort and \n\u00adfatigue; encourage robust nutrition; and provide \nfrequent rest breaks, hygiene, and comfort to pre\u00ad\nvent crying, particularly when the child is cyanotic.\n\u2022\t Encourage safe recommended physical activity, \nwhich can improve physical status and quality of life.\n\u2022\t Monitor precise daily weights, as well as intake and \noutput, to determine nutritional, fluid, and electro\u00ad\nlyte status.\n\u2022\t Adhere to the medication regimen, while monitor\u00ad\ning for intended effects and unwanted reactions.\n\u2022\t Monitor for effective or poor coping by the child \nand family. Use anticipatory guidance and coordi\u00ad\nnate care team resources, including social services \nand Child Life specialists.\nCongenital Heart Defects\nThere are several approaches to categorizing CHDs. A \nvery generalized organization is to group the defects into \nacyanotic (left-to-right cardiac blood flow) and cyanotic \nBEST PRACTICES\nA\nny heart defect or condition that results in abnormal blood \nflow from the right-sided chambers of the heart, called \na \u201cright-to-left shunt,\u201d can produce cyanosis, ranging from \nvery subtle to profoundly severe. Pulse oximetry is useful in \ndetecting suboptimal oxygenation that has not reached the \nthreshold for cyanosis.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nM\neasuring blood pressure in children can be challenging, \nas care provider\u2013related variations in technique, timing, \nbody position, and equipment selection may result in BP \ninaccuracy, which can adversely impact care. Undersized BP \ncuffs can result in falsely elevated readings, whereas overly \nlarge cuffs can result in falsely low readings.\nA simple bedside test that can help distinguish be\u00ad\ntween cardiac or respiratory causes in children who are \nhypoxemic is a hyperoxygenation test. In this test, the \ninfant is put on 100% oxygen for 20 minutes and a blood \ngas sample is drawn. Infants with cyanotic CHD will not \nhave significantly increased Po2.\nCongestive Heart Failure\nCongestive heart failure is typically a secondary pathol\u00ad\nogy to a CHD or acquired CV dysfunction.

The child may be asymptomatic or present with a murmur. A late harsh \nmurmur may sometimes be heard after pulmonary pressures decrease at 4 to 8 weeks of age. Shortness of breath, failure to \nthrive (FTT), feeding difficulties, and a lower left sternal border systolic thrill can be present.\nTreatment: Echocardiogram will show an enlarged left atrium. Chest X-ray may show an enlarged heart and increased lung \nvascularity. Large defects must be surgically closed.

It can be due to persistence of a fetal shunt, involving \nthe foramen ovale. Flow is left to right; flow may be increased to the lungs.\nAssessment: May have a harsh, loud murmur or be asymptomatic. The size of the right atrium may potentially be increased, \nand the child may have mild CHF.\nTreatment: Large defects must be surgically closed. Small defects may be repaired via cardiac catheterization with a patch.

Annual check-ups with the cardiologist are encouraged.\nAortic Stenosis (AS)\nDiagnosis: Stenosis (narrowing) of the aortic valve and adjacent vessel wall that obstructs flow from the left ventricle to the \naorta. May have aortic valve regurgitation. The increased workload on the left ventricle leads to hypertrophy (enlargement) of \nthe left ventricular wall. The child will be ductal dependent if the AS is severe.\nAssessment: Risk factors include group A Streptococcus infections. Findings include a lower systolic BP and narrow pulse \npressure (difference between the systolic and diastolic values), fatigue, activity intolerance (can lead to sudden death), syncope, \nshortness of breath, systolic murmur, and chest pain.\n(continues)\n\t\nCongenital Heart Defects\t\n275\n", "Treatment: Diagnostics such as echocardiogram, chest X-ray, cardiac catheterization with balloon valvuloplasty (widening \nthe opening by pulling a small balloon through it) if possible, or open-heart aortic valve replacement.

If drug therapy does not \nresult in duct closure, then surgical ligation is performed.\nTABLE 19-2\u2003\nSelected Acyanotic Disorders (continued)\n276\t\nChapter 19\u2003 Cardiovascular: Perfusion\n", "TABLE 19-3\u2003\nSelected Cyanotic Disorders: Right-to-Left Flow\nTetralogy of Fallot (TOF)\nDiagnosis: Four malformations that result in mixed blood and restricted blood flow to the lungs, usually resulting in a right-to-\nleft shunt: pulmonary stenosis (PS), overriding aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular septal defect (VSD).\nAssessment: Third most common heart defect. Associated with DiGeorge syndrome and Down syndrome. Occurs more often \nin males. Right-to-left shunt. Murmur, dyspnea when active, and polycythemia. As the PDA closes, cyanosis increases. Clubbed \ndigits can be found. A \u201cboot-shaped\u201d cardiac silhouette may be observed on X-ray (Figure 19-6).\nFigure 19-6\u2002 X-ray of \u201cboot-shaped\u201d heart in tetralogy of Fallot.\n\u00a9 Diomedia / ISM / SOVEREIGN\nTreatment: The most common method of treating TOF is complete intracardiac repair in infancy. With infants who are too \nsmall or weak to tolerate the surgery, the healthcare team may opt for a previously common strategy\u2014performing a procedure \nto temporarily improve blood flow to the lungs so that complete repair of the defect can be performed when the child is older \nand stronger (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2011). Priorities are to manage CHF symptoms, minimize hypoxia, and \nprovide enough nutrition to support growth and development. The nurse and family should prevent crying, dehydration, \nconstipation, fever, and pain, which can provoke hypercyanosis \u201ctet\u201d spells (acute profound decreases in pulmonary flow) \nand lead to hypoxic brain injury. Immediate interventions include putting the child in a knee-to-chest position to increase \nsystemic vascular resistance and pulmonary flow. This position should be coupled with oxygen administration, anticipation and \nprevention of provoking conditions, and calming of the child. In severe cases, the pediatric nurse may need to give morphine to \ndecrease pain and dilate the child\u2019s pulmonary vasculature, thereby stopping the tet spell.\nDextro-Transposition of the Great Arteries (d-TGA)\nDiagnosis: Defect in which the two great vessels\u2014the pulmonary artery and aorta\u2014are reversed. Oxygenated blood cycles to \nand from the lungs without going to the systemic circulation. Deoxygenated blood does not circulate to the lungs. This severe \ndisorder is ductal dependent. An \u201cegg on a string\u201d cardiac silhouette can be observed on X-ray. \nAssessment: Profound cyanosis, tachypnea, and negative hyperoxygenation test.\nTreatment: Prompt intravenous access and administration of PGE-1 to stabilize the child prior to an immediate surgical \nintervention, which consists of an initial balloon atrial septostomy and a later arterial switch procedure (Jatene switch). Nursing \ncare includes maintaining oxygen saturation, giving PGE-1 and ACE inhibitors to promote coronary perfusion, and providing \npostoperative care.\nTricuspid Atresia (TA)\nDiagnosis: Rare. Atresia means completely blocked or missing. The malformed tricuspid valve blocks blood flow from the right \natrium to the right ventricle, radically decreasing blood flow to the lungs. If no VSD is present, then the TA is ductal dependent \nand the PDA must be maintained for survival.\n(continues)\n\t\nCongenital Heart Defects\t\n277\n", "RESEARCH EVIDENCE\nAssessment of Capillary Refill Time\nCurrent research has resulted in a recommendation for a \nstandardized method to assess capillary refill time (CRT) in \npatients. Moderate pressure on the fingertip for 5 seconds \nwith an ambient temperature between 20 and 25\u00b0C \n(68\u00b0F\u201377\u00b0F) results in the most reliable measurement \n\u00ad(Fleming et\u00a0al., 2015).\nAssessment: Cyanosis, murmur, dyspnea, clubbing, and poor growth. Echocardiogram, ECG, chest X-ray, and cardiac \ncatheterization are all indicated. This condition requires three-stage surgical repair and possibly heart transplant.\nTreatment: Maintain PGE-1 infusion. Prepare the child and parents for surgery. Anticipatory guidance and counseling \nare required for the adjustment to a lifelong cardiac care plan and for the possibility of heart transplant. Monitor for CHF, \ntachycardia, and chronic diarrhea.\nHypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)\nDiagnosis: Second most common CHD; ductal dependent. Severe underdevelopment of the left side of the heart, aortic valve, \naorta, left ventricle, and mitral valve results in pulmonary congestion and edema.\nAssessment: The child will be asymptomatic until the ductus arteriosus closes, at which point the child becomes tachypneic, \ndyspneic, and cyanotic and demonstrates ashen skin color coupled with poor perfusion and a murmur with gallop. Immediate \nthree-stage surgical repair must be initiated, and the family must anticipate the need for heart transplant.\nTreatment: Parents are given the option of supportive care only, which usually leads quickly to death; staged reconstructive \nsurgery; or heart transplant. The risks and benefits of the two therapeutic options are approximately equivalent, as the difficulty \nand risk of the staged surgery is balanced by the difficulty of obtaining a suitable heart for transplantation (Si, Ohye, Bove, & \nHirsch-Romano, 2014). Echocardiogram, chest X-ray, preparation for surgery, and provision of postoperative care are included in \nthe child\u2019s treatment plan. The initial surgery in the staged reconstruction is undertaken as soon as possible (ideally less than \n1 month) after birth, and subsequent surgeries complete the reconstruction. Lifelong medications and follow-up with \ncardiology team will be required. The nurse should prepare the caregivers for their child having a severe condition and provide \nsupport. The child will have an increased risk for bacterial endocarditis, so an infection prevention protocol will be needed.\nTABLE 19-3\u2003\nSelected Cyanotic Disorders: Right-to-Left Flow (continued)\na chronic or acute decrease in the ability of the heart to \npump adequate amounts of blood to the body, which causes \ncongestion or backup of fluid into the systemic vascular \nand/or pulmonary vasculature, negatively impacting \nperfusion. CHF is directly related to a malfunctioning \nventricular muscle.\nIn addition to assessing for the four main signs of CHF \n(tachycardia, tachypnea, enlarged heart, and enlarged \nliver), the pediatric nurse should note the following symp\u00ad\ntoms of a child experiencing CHF: (1) generalized pallor; \n(2) diaphoresis; (3) murmurs including S3 and S4; (4) cool \nextremities with weak pulses and slow capillary refill; \n(5) poor appetite and growth failure; (6) fatigue and activity \nintolerance; and (7) oliguria.\nSigns of systemic (peripheral) venous congestion \ninclude peripheral edema, jugular vein distention (not \nseen in infants), liver and spleen enlargement, and ascites. \nPulmonary congestion linked to heart failure can be mani\u00ad\nfested as tachypnea, dyspnea, grunting, stridor, retractions, \nexercise intolerance, and recurring respiratory infections.\nThe main goals of treatment to improve the cardiac \noutput for patients with CHF are the following: (1) reduce \ncardiac workload; (2) maximize contractility; (3) improve \nperfusion and oxygenation; (4) minimize fluid overload; \nand (5) provide optimal nutritional support.\nDigoxin Therapy\nOne of the medication mainstays of treatment of CHF is \ndigitalis glycoside (digoxin) therapy, which can improve \nthe contractility of the heart without increasing heart \nrate, improve cardiac output, and improve perfusion and \noxygenation. Digoxin is available as an oral elixir with a \n0.05 mg/mL concentration. Infant doses are calculated in \nmicrograms (1000 mcg = 1 mg). An initial digitizing dose \nis given; then, depending on its effects, a maintenance dose \nis determined. Two nurses must double-check the dosing \nand the amount drawn up. Digoxin has a very narrow \ntherapeutic window with a high potential for overdose \nand toxicity. Signs of digoxin toxicity include nausea, \nvomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, visual disturbances, \nbradycardia, and arrhythmias.\n278\t\nChapter 19\u2003 Cardiovascular: Perfusion\n", "\u2022\t Have Poison Control Center contact informa\u00ad\ntion readily available, and notify the healthcare \nteam immediately in the event of an unintentional \noverdose.\nAcquired Cardiac Disorders\nAlthough much more common in adults, acquired heart \ndisease can occur in children throughout the age spectrum \nand developmental period. Common acquired cardiac \ndisorders in children are explored in this section.\nRheumatic Heart Disease\nDiagnosis\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease affecting the \nconnective tissues that occurs after the child experiences a \ngroup A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) infection \nsuch as strep throat or scarlet fever. These infections can \ncause heart valve damage, which then contributes to the \ndevelopment of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Antibod\u00ad\nies produced cause lesions to develop in joints and heart \nconnective tissues. Untreated RHD can cause clusters of \nbacterial or fungal organisms that can embolize to the \nbrain, kidneys, and lungs.\nRisk Factors\nChildren at risk have untreated streptococcal infections, \nwith symptoms appearing approximately two weeks after \nthe infection\u2019s onset. Rheumatic fever primarily affects \nchildren between ages 5 and 15 years. RHD has familial \ntendencies.\nTreatment\nIf rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease is suspected, \nthen a throat culture may be taken to confirm the presence \nof a streptococcal infection. ECG and echocardiogram \nmay be performed, looking for cardiomegaly and carditis. \n\u00adAssessments for symptoms of rheumatic heart disease in\u00ad\nclude (1) fever; (2) a very painful, swollen, red joint (usually \na knee, elbow, shoulder, or ankle, in which the swelling \nand inflammation recede and move to another joint); \n(3) nosebleeds; (4) brief periods of skin rashes (less common); \n(5) shortness of breath; (6) chest pain, abnormal heart \nrhythm, or murmur; and (7) abdominal pain.\nNursing care includes care and monitoring of CHF, \nadministration of antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory \nmedications. Patient and family teaching focus on \nscreening school-age children for sore throat. Provide \neducation about antibiotic dental prophylaxis. If heart \nvalve damage is significant, valve replacement will be \nnecessary.\nThe following guidelines should be followed when \nadministering digoxin:\n\u2022\t Take the child\u2019s apical pulse for a full minute prior \nto giving the dose. If available in the healthcare set\u00ad\nting, an ECG strip can be saved for confirmation of \nan accurate heart rate and documentation.\n\u2022\t Do not give digoxin if the heart rate is less than 90 \nbeats/min for infants or less than 70 beats/min for \nolder children. The adult threshold is less than 60 \nbeats/min. Written drug orders should specify the \nheart rate required for dosing.\n\u2022\t Oral dosing is twice daily, usually at 8 a.m. \nand\u00a08\u00a0p.m.\n\u2022\t Do not mix digoxin with food; give water after the \ndose to prevent tooth decay due to the sweetened \nelixir.\n\u2022\t If a dose is missed, do not make it up. Instead, give \nthe next dose on schedule.\n\u2022\t Do not redose the medication if the child vomits.\n\u2022\t If more than two consecutive doses are missed, \ncontact the physician or practitioner.\n\u2022\t Closely monitor the child for signs of toxicity.\n\u2022\t Provide effective caregiver teaching for safe home \nadministration of digoxin.\n\u2022\t Store digoxin in a safe location, preferably one that \nis locked.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nMedications Used for Diuresis for CHF\nDiuretics used to treat CHF disease are given in the morn\u00ad\ning to allow maximum rest at night.\n\u2022\t Furosemide (Lasix): Loop diuretic. Monitor electrolyte \nlevels, especially potassium. Watch for ototoxicity \nand development of renal calculi with long-term use. \nEncourage consumption of foods with high potas\u00ad\nsium content, and watch for signs of dehydration and \nallergic response.\n\u2022\t Bumetanide (Bumex): Loop diuretic. Monitor elec\u00ad\ntrolyte levels, especially potassium. May worsen \nototoxicity with aminoglycoside use. Encourage \nconsumption of high-potassium foods; avoid sun \nexposure. Watch for signs of dehydration or nausea/\nvomiting.\n\u2022\t Spironolactone (Aldactone): Potassium sparing. \nGive missed doses when discovered, but do not \ndouble-dose. Maintain strict intake and output (I & O) \nrecords. Monitor potassium levels.\n\u2022\t Hydrochlorothiazide (Diuril): Potassium sparing. \nGive missed doses when discovered, but do not \ndouble-dose. Take with food. Avoid sun exposure. \nNSAIDs decrease effectiveness. Call the physician if \ndehydration, nausea, or diarrhea occurs.\n\t\nAcquired Cardiac Disorders\t\n279\n", "for 6 to 8 weeks, which can be lifesaving despite the risk of \nReye syndrome associated with this medication. Monitor\u00ad\ning is needed for CHF, myocarditis, leaky heart valves, and \npericardial effusions.\nKawasaki Disease\nDiagnosis\nKawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart \ndisease in children. This inflammatory process affects the skin, \nblood vessels (when blood vessels are affected throughout \nthe body, the condition is called panvasculitis), mucous \nmembranes, and the lymph system. Although its cause is \nunknown, KD has been documented to follow viral infec\u00ad\ntions and toxic exposures. The condition is not contagious, \nbut it can mimic other infectious diseases such as scarlet \nfever or measles.\nSymptoms of KD include high fever, conjunctivitis, \nenlarged lymph nodes, red lips, and a \u201cstrawberry\u201d tongue \n(Figure 19-7). The child may demonstrate edematous and \nerythematous hands and feet, extreme irritability, groin rash, \nand signs of cardiac involvement on echocardiogram and \nX-ray. Initially, the child will show increased white blood \ncells (WBCs), lymphocytes, and platelet counts.\nAlthough complete cure is possible, KD causes scarring \nof the coronary arteries and can lead to coronary aneurysm \nto the point that 73% of patients have a myocardial infarc\u00ad\ntion within the first year after diagnosis (Brogan et\u00a0al., \n2002). Close monitoring for progression of the vascular \ninflammatory process is needed.\nRisk Factors\nRisk factors include Asian descent and age younger than \n6 years. Nevertheless, KD can strike persons of all races \nand any age group.\nTreatment\nImmediate administration of intravenous immunoglobulin \n(IVIG) is required, with significant improvement usually \nnoted within 24 hours. High-dose aspirin therapy is used \nFigure 19-7\u2002 Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include \u201cstrawberry\u201d \ntongue. \n\u00a9 Dr. Ken Greer/Visual Unlimited, Inc.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nHealthcare Maintenance for Survivors of CHD\nAs advancements in care for children with CHD occur, their \nlife expectancy continues to improve. Currently, nearly 1 in \n150 adults is living with CHD in the United States. Infant and \nchildhood deaths from congenital heart defects typically occur \nwhen the child is fewer than 28 days old and is considered \nthe leading cause of birth defects related death during early \ninfancy (CDC, 2016). This shift in the number of children with \nCHD reaching adolescence and adulthood demands that \nnursing adjust care planning to prepare children with CHD \nand families for the teen and young adult years. School-age \nchildren are ideal learners for teaching on healthcare needs \nand coaching on self-care for the future. A multidisciplinary \nteam approach is necessary to address these children\u2019s unique \nphysical, cognitive, socioemotional, and developmental needs \n(Boyle, Kelly, Reynolds, Conlan, & Taylor, 2015).\nSub-bacterial Endocarditis\nDiagnosis\nWhen the cardiac endocardium becomes inflamed by \ninfection with a streptococcal or staphylococcal organism, \nthe resulting sub-bacterial endocarditis (SBE) can be life \nthreatening.\nRisk Factors\nRisk factors associated with SBE include a past history \nof heart valve damage, and replacement of or damage \nto the endocardium. Organisms entering the body via \ndental work, tooth brushing, cuts, catheters, or respira\u00ad\ntory infections may cause the initial infection. Symptoms \ninclude fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, murmur, \njoint pain, petechiae, flank pain, weight loss, and fatigue. \nSkin and nail signs may be present. Retinal Roth spots \nare seen early.\nTreatment\nBlood cultures, CBC, and echocardiogram are all required \nfor confirmation of SBE. Intensive antibiotic therapy is \nnecessary. The nurse will monitor for stroke, poor cardiac \noutput and CHF, and antibiotic-induced nausea, vomit\u00ad\ning, and diarrhea. The nurse should prepare the child and \nfamily for valve replacement surgery.\n280\t\nChapter 19\u2003 Cardiovascular: Perfusion\n", "BEST PRACTICES\nPediatric Care Team: Focus on Child Life Specialists\nPlay is the essential work of the child. Play can be therapeutic and very soothing for children with healthcare issues. Without an \nopportunity to play, children cannot achieve their optimal developmental goals. Thus, play must be preserved and play oppor\u00ad\ntunities planned for hospitalized children.\nChild Life specialists (CLS) are bachelor\u2019s- or master\u2019s-prepared professionals with expertise in helping children and families deal \nwith life\u2019s challenging events. They provide emotional support for families, deliver education, and encourage optimal development \nof children facing challenges, particularly those related to health care and hospitalization.\nCLS promote effective coping through play, preparation, education, and self-expression activities. Some hospitals have \ndesignated play rooms, which are protected areas where no medical care can interrupt play, and programs designed and \nmanaged by CLS.\nCase Study\nChang Hung, a 14-month-old child with trisomy 21 and a ven\u00ad\ntricular septal defect, was admitted to the pediatric unit with \ntachypnea, tachycardia, poor appetite, and decreased activity. \nHis concerned parents were at his bedside continuously. Initial \nvital signs were temperature of 98.2\u00b0F, heart rate of 144 beats/\nmin, respiration rate of 56 breaths/min, BP of 92/68 mm Hg, \nand oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The toddler had \nmild edema to distal extremities; was pale, mottled, and thin; \nand appeared fatigued. He had subcostal retractions, clear lung \nfields, soft systolic heart murmur, hypoactive bowel sounds, \nand a palpable liver border 2 cm below the costal margin. He \nwas tachypneic and diaphoretic when eating or drinking. Urine \noutput was 1 mL/kg/hr, and he had slightly cool extremities \nwith weak peripheral pulses. Capillary refill time was delayed, \nat 4 to 5 seconds. His chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and \nmild pulmonary edema.\nThis patient was ultimately diagnosed with congestive heart \nfailure (CHF). Orders were to start digoxin, diuretics, and ACE \ninhibitors. A 23-guage peripheral intravenous saline lock was \nstarted. Oxygen was immediately delivered at 2 L/min via nasal \ncannula, and efforts were made to keep the child comforted. \nHis parents were encouraged to participate in his care.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t What will the pediatric healthcare team, including the \nnurse, evaluate to determine whether the plan of care \nand medications are having the desired effect?\n2.\t Are there any nursing concerns or special administration \nguidelines for digoxin?\n3.\t Which concerns for nutritional support will the health\u00ad\ncare team have for this child?

This process begins \nwith development of tactile sense, vestibular sense, pro-\nprioception, and gustatory taste buds (differentiating \nsweet, salty, bitter, and sour). The most abundant number \nof taste buds (7000) are developed by birth. Development \nof the olfactory sense follows, then hearing, and finally \nvision (Kenner & McGrath, 2010). Most of these senses \nare functional between 24 and 32 weeks\u2019 gestation, except \nfor vision. By the time the infant reaches six months of \nage, depth perception, color, acuity, and eye movements \n(tracking) have developed, but it takes up to a year for \nvision to fully develop (Kenner & McGrath, 2010).\nMaternal health, environment, maternal recreational \nand prescribed medication use, and prematurity are just \na few of the conditions that can alter the fetus\u2019s brain \ndevelopment during the critical time of sensory matura-\ntion. If a fetus is subjected to any of these conditions, the \nconnections (synapses) that build the framework for brain \ndevelopment may be changed or altered. For example, if \na baby is born prematurely, typical sources of stimulation \n(e.g., noise, lights, pain from heel sticks) can alter normal \nbrain development. Although prematurity will not alter \nthe sequence in which the senses mature, it will alter the \nfoundation of the sensory system as a whole compared to \nthat of the term-gestation baby.\nImmediate skin-to-skin contact, also known as kanga-\nroo care, has been adopted as a standard in many delivery \nrooms, including for women who have undergone cesarean \nsections. This tactile contact provides the sensations that \nthe term newborn needs. The feel of the mother\u2019s warmth, \nher smell, her voice, and even the taste of her skin typically \ndraw the baby into a natural position for breastfeeding \n(Bergman & Bergman, 2010). Studies have shown that \nskin-to-skin contact after delivery can stabilize neonatal \nbreathing, temperature, and blood sugar; reduce crying; \nand produce a much calmer newborn. This exposure to \nthe external environment is the first step in which the \nnewborn begins to establish a sense of trust with the im-\nmediate surroundings.\nNurses need to include the co-parent in the skin-to-skin \ncontact. The inclusion of the co-parent not only builds a \nbond, but also creates a safe environment for the neonate. \nSafety is one of the foundational principles of the first \nstage of development according to Erik Erikson\u2019s stages \nof psychosocial development.\nIntroduction\nSensory perception is a concept that describes the use and \nexperience of the sensory organs across the developmental \nperiod. This concept includes normal development of the \nsensory organs as well as the deviations that can occur. \nDeviations in sensory perception can be primary (existing \nfrom birth) or secondary, where the child suffers a disease, \ninjury, or traumatic event. The pediatric nurse works \nwith the healthcare team to ensure that patients enjoy a \nhealthy state of being that promotes sensory development. \nFocusing on safety allows the child to have an expected \nsequential development of sensory organ maturation. \nAnticipatory guidance for parents includes promoting a \ncomplete immunization schedule, as childhood infectious \ndiseases can cause injury to the sensory organs. When \nchildren experience trauma, disease, or injury that af-\nfects the sensory organs, the nurse works with the family \nand interdisciplinary team to prevent the development of \nsensory deprivation.\nThe concept of sensory perception includes various \nsensory organs and sensory experiences. The seven sen-\nsory experiences include the olfactory (smell), gustatory \n(taste), visual, auditory, proprioceptive (sense of body \nawareness), vestibular (sense of movement and balance), \nand tactile senses. A child\u2019s cognition, neurologic health, \nlevel of consciousness, orientation, health, and well-being \nall highly influence sensory perception (Figure 20-1). \nChildren with neurologic conditions that affect level of \nconsciousness or the ability to process sensory input \nmay have a severe reduction in their sensory perception. \nFigure 20-1\u2002 A child\u2019s cognition, neurologic health, level of \u00adconsciousness, \norientation, health, and well-being all highly influence sensory perception.\n\u00a9 Wasu Watcharadachaphong/Shutterstock.\n\t\nSensory Development\t\n285\n", "Hearing Disorders\nThe sensation of hearing is a complex process. Sound waves \ntraveling through the external and internal structures of \nthe ear stimulate the auditory nerve, which then sends \nsignals to the brain. The brain interprets these electrical \nsignals as sounds. This form of communication allows \nus to understand our environment, with the stimulation \ninfluencing our behaviors and actions.\nHearing begins when sound travels through the canal \nfrom the outer ear, hitting the eardrum (tympanic mem\u00ad\nbrane). As the eardrum vibrates from these sound waves, \nthe bones of the middle ear\u2014malleus, incus, and stapes\u2014\nconnect with the cochlear of the inner ear, which is filled \nwith fluid, and transmit the sound forward. A membrane \nin the cochlea is separated into two parts: an upper segment \nand a lower segment. Sensory hair cells situated on top \nof this membrane move in tandem with the vibrations of \nthe sounds coming into the cochlea. This vibration allows \nchemoreceptors to rush in, creating a signal that the audi\u00ad\ntory nerve carries to the brain and interprets as a specific \nsound with meaning (National Institutes of Health [NIH], \nNational Institute on Deaf and Other Communication \nDisorders [NIDCD], 2014).\nHearing loss is categorized as conductive, sensorineural, \nor mixed. Conductive hearing loss involves problems with \nthe ear canal, eardrum, or middle ear structures. Common \ncauses of conductive hearing loss are malformation of the \nouter ear structures, repeated ear infections, foreign body, \nand perforation of the eardrum.\nSensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) involves damage to the \nauditory nerve or the inner ear structures. Causes of SNHL \ninclude exposure to loud noise, head trauma, family history, \nillness, or ototoxic drugs. Ototoxic medications include an\u00ad\ntibiotics such as aminoglycosides, antifungals, nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), chemotherapy, loop \ndiuretics, and salicylate medications (Bisht & Bist, 2011). \nIn some cases (e.g., with NSAIDs or aspirin), the toxicity \ndepends on the dose and is reversible; in others, the damage \nmay be permanent (e.g., with neomycin, a highly ototoxic \nantibiotic) (Taneja, Varshney, Taneja, & Varshney, 2015). It \nis the bedside nurse\u2019s role to administer these ototoxic drugs \naccording to the recommendations. The nurse must be aware \nof potential side effects and drug compatibility.\nMixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive hear\u00ad\ning loss and SNHL, which may involve all ear structures: \nouter, middle, inner ear and the auditory nerve.\nWarning signs of possible hearing loss include, but are not \nlimited to, tinnitus, buzzing noise, slight muffling of sounds, \ndifficulty understanding speech despite hearing sound, and \nthe perception of being unsure of the direction sound is \ncoming from. Sound is measured in decibels (dB), a unit \nFAMILY EDUCATION\nA\nnticipatory guidance includes teaching parents and care\u00ad\ngivers to provide protection from hearing loss. Children \nneed protection if they will be exposed to sounds that may \npotentially damage inner ear structures. A child\u2019s ears will \nexperience pain after being exposed to a sound at the level of \n90 dB. Music played at rock concerts can be as loud as 110 to \n120 dB. Teaching of parents and children/teens about hearing \nprotection should provide guidance in hearing protection and \ninjury prevention. Hearing protection includes:\n\u2022\t Ear plugs\n\u2022\t Ear muffs (Figure 20-2)\n\u2022\t Hearing protection through smaller ear cups on head\u00ad\nphones that completely cover the outer ear structures\nFigure 20-2\u2002 Ear muffs can provide protection from hearing loss.\n\u00a9 PeopleImages/DigitalVision/Getty Images\nTABLE 20-1\u2003\nDecibel Levels of Everyday Sounds\n45 dB: Refrigerator motor\n50 dB: Rainfall\n60 dB: Typical speech\n75 dB: Washing machine\n85 dB: Busy city traffic\n90 dB: Gas mower, hair dryer\n100 dB: iPod\n110 dB: Leaf blower, rock concert\n120 dB: Ambulance, jack hammer\n140 dB: Fireworks and jet airliner directly overhead\nData from Hearing Loss Association of America.

Although otitis media is the \nmost common childhood infection for which antibiotics are \nprescribed, and there has been a decrease in the complication \nof mastoiditis, antibacterial medications are not encouraged \nunless the child does not demonstrate clinical improvement.\n24 hours are considered at risk for hearing loss, according to \nthe National Institute of Health\u2019s National Institute on Deaf\u00ad\nness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD, 2017).\nChildren are more sensitive to sounds than adults are, \nand the same sounds can register up to 20 dB greater in \na child than in the average adult. According to the NIH\u2019s \nNIDCD (2017), 17% of teens age 12 to 19 have some \n\u00addegree of hearing loss\u2014a phenomenon that is believed to \nbe related to use of MP3 players and other mobile auditory \nmusic devices at high volume levels.\nThe state of California, as well as many other states, has \nestablished a newborn hearing screening program (NHSP) \nthat is available to all families prior to discharge from the \nhospital. This screening seeks to identify hearing loss early \nand link families to resources by the time the infant reaches \nsix months of age. Infants born at home, at birthing centers, \nor at other alternative birthing sites should have follow-up \ncare that includes assessment by the screening program. For \nfurther information on this required or offered screening, \ncontact the National Center for Hearing Assessment and \nManagement (http://www.infanthearing.org/screening/).\nAcute Otitis Media\nOtitis media\u2014ear infection\u2014may have either a viral or \na bacterial origin. Acute otitis media (AOM) is defined \nas an inflammation of the middle ear space with a rapid \nonset of signs and symptoms of an acute infection such as \nfever and ear pain. It occurs most frequently in children \nyounger than 24 months, and is usually preceded by an up\u00ad\nper respiratory infection (URI). AOM is usually diagnosed \nby otoscopic visualization of the tympanic membrane for \npus, bulging, purulent drainage, or redness. Depending \non whether URI symptoms are present, waiting 72 hours \nfor clinical improvement has been recommended, rather \nthan immediately starting antibiotic treatment. However, \nantibiotic treatment is recommended for children younger \nthan 6 months due to their immature immune systems. \nMyringotomy\u2014the placement of eardrum tubes via a \nprocedure involving a surgical incision of the eardrum \n(tympanoplasty)\u2014may be indicated if the pain is severe \n(Hockenberry & Wilson, 2009).\nVisual Disorders\nDuring fetal development, the eye develops at 16 weeks\u2019 \ngestation. Blood vessels begin to form at the optic nerve, \nproviding oxygen and nutrients to the developing retina. \nThe retina grows rapidly, especially during the last 12 \nweeks of pregnancy, and its development continues up to \n1 month after birth.\nAccording to the National Eye Institute (NIH/NEI, 2011), \n4% of preschoolers have myopia (nearsightedness) and 21% \nhave hyperopia (farsightedness). Another childhood visual \ndisorder\u2014astigmatism (irregular curvature of the eye)\u2014is \nfound in 10% of preschoolers. These three disorders repre\u00ad\nsent the most common visual disorders in children and are \ncollectively classified as refractive errors, or errors associated \nwith abnormalities of the eye shape that alter the conversion \nof light into signals for brain interpretation. Refractive errors \nare correctable. The preschooler developmental stage is an \nimportant time to conduct visual screening and treatment \nprior to the child engaging in elementary school academics.\nTwo other visual conditions that are less common but \nnot rare, affecting approximately 3% of children (Friedman \net\u00a0al., 2009), are strabismus (crossed eyes) and amblyopia \n(lazy eye). These misalignments of the eyes affect vision by \ndisrupting the brain\u2019s ability to merge left- and right-eye \nimages appropriately. Ultimately, the brain suppresses signals \nfrom one eye or the other, leading to an effect of functional \nblindness in one eye. Both conditions can be corrected \nvia vision training, orthoptics, surgery, botulinum toxin \ninjection, or a combination of approaches. Most authorities \nagree that obtaining early treatment for either condition \n(e.g., before age 5) produces the best results (Bradfield, \n2013; Wright & Spiegel, 2013).\nBox 20-1 lists the various visual disturbances found \nin children.\nBOX 20-1\u2002 Visual Disturbances in Childhood\n\u2022\t Albinism-related visual disturbances\n\u2022\t Amblyopia\n\u2022\t Aniridia\n\u2022\t Astigmatism\n\u2022\t Cataract\n\u2022\t Cortical visual impairment\n\u2022\t Diabetic retinopathy\n\u2022\t Glaucoma\n\u2022\t Hyperopia\n\u2022\t Myopia\n\u2022\t Nystigmatism\n\u2022\t Optic nerve atrophy\n\u2022\t Retinoblastoma\n\u2022\t Retinopathy of prematurity\n\u2022\t Strabismus\n\t\nVisual Disorders\t\n287\n", "halts due to hyperoxia from the supplemental oxygen that \nmany premature babies receive to support their immature \nrespiratory system. Phase 2 begins later, during weeks 32 to \n34 of life. This phase is marked by abnormal blood vessel \ngrowth, which can potentially cause retinal detachment \n(Friddle, 2013).\nSeverity of ROP is classified based on the zone, extent, \nstage, and presence of disease (Figure 20-3). There are \nfive stages (I\u2013V), ranging from mild to complete retinal \ndetachment. Approximately 90% of infants with ROP have \na mild case and do not require any treatment. In contrast, \nthose with the most severe form of ROP may have impaired \nvision and possibly blindness from retinal detachment. On \nan annual basis, approximately 1100 to 1500 premature \ninfants develop severe ROP, requiring treatment; 400 to \n600 infants are classified as legally blind from ROP each \nyear (NIH/NEI, 2016a).\nTreatment modalities for ROP include laser therapy \nand cryotherapy. The goal of treatment is to slow or reverse \nthe abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, but both \nof these therapies are known to affect peripheral vision. \nTheir long-term side effects are not known.\nLight reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit \n(NICU) has not been shown to decrease the incidence \nof ROP in low-birth-weight infants based on studies \nsupported by the National Eye Institute. Instead, preven\u00ad\ntion of ROP focuses on preventing preterm births, early \nscreening and detection for infants born at less than \n28 weeks\u2019 gestation and weighing less than 1500 g, and \nRetinopathy of Prematurity\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disorder in which the \nblood vessels in the retina develop abnormally, potentially \nleading to blindness. A variety of factors may contribute to \nROP, including prematurity, low birth weight, and hypoxia. \nPremature infants born at less than 31 weeks\u2019 gestation \nand weighing less than 1250 g are at highest risk. Oxygen \nis considered a contributing factor in the development \nof ROP, which explains why it is important to monitor \noxygen saturation levels for all infants who receive oxygen \nand adjust the Fio2 according to the specified institutional \nparameters (NIH/NEI, 2016a).\nROP occurs in two phases. Phase 1 occurs between 30 \nand 32 weeks of life. In this phase, blood vessel growth \nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nT\nhere is a higher incidence of myopia (nearsightedness) in \nHispanic (3%) and African American populations. Astigma\u00ad\ntism (irregular curvature of the eye) is also more common in \nAfrican American children (9%) and Hispanic children (25%) \n(NIH/NEI, n.d.). Pediatric healthcare team members must be \naware of health disparities and ethnic influences related to \nimportant pediatric health conditions and recognize that \nscreening children for eye disorders so they can be corrected \nearly will strongly affect children\u2019s academic success. Screening \nmust be a priority, along with adequate case management \nand follow-through for treatment.\nFigure 20-3\u2002 Zones of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).\nClock hours\nRight eye\nZone III\nMacula\nZone I\nZone I\nZone III\nZone II\nZone II\nOptic\nnerve\n12\n3\n6\n9\n12\n3\n6\n9\nOra serrata\nLeft eye\n288\t\nChapter 20\u2003 Sensory Perceptions: Impairments and Disorders\n", "Concepts in Communication \nDevelopment for Visually Impaired or \nHearing-Impaired Children\nFor infants who are born with a hearing or visual impair\u00ad\nment, it is very important to feel secure and safe in their \nfamiliar environment. This is the first step toward building \ntrust in the first year of life. Bonding with the primary care\u00ad\ngiver forms one of the most important relationships for the \nchild; it acts as a foundation for trust to be created with the \noutside world. Parents need to form that trusting bond, read \ntheir children\u2019s cues as they learn to communicate, interpret \ntheir needs, and act promptly to provide what is needed.\nEvery child\u2019s reaction to sensory stimulation is different. \nIt is up to the caregivers to read these cues, interpret them, \nand engage the child to communicate with family members \nand others. To be successful, caregivers must provide a safe \nenvironment for the child, build trust, include the child in \nthe activity from beginning to end, and develop their own \nlanguage for activities such as saying hello or goodbye, dia\u00ad\nper changes, play, thirst, hunger, or boredom. Parents and \ncaregivers also need to pause and watch the child\u2019s reactions, \nas it may take some time for the child to respond to cues \nthat a non-impaired child would react to immediately. The \nchild may become frightened, confused, or even angry if \nsomeone unexpectedly touches him or her without warning.\nIn hearing-impaired children as well as in children with \nother neurologic impairments such as apraxia (Tierney, \nPitterle, Kurtz, Nakhla, & Todorow, 2016), use of sign lan\u00ad\nguage has been known to start young, as early as infancy. \nHelping children identify a language with which they can \ncommunicate with others helps them to understand the \noutside world (Napoli et\u00a0al., 2015). While learning, it is \nimportant to observe for signs of overstimulation. The \nchild should be encouraged to explore the surroundings \ntogether with the caregiver, with each guiding the other. \nChildren benefit from having choices, having some degree \nof control over their own environment so they will not feel \nalone, and interacting with others. Their environment should \nbe adjusted as needed so that children have their space for \nactivities and play; routines are very important to them. The \nnurse should encourage the use of all the senses, including \ntactile, olfactory, and gustatory senses, if appropriate, to \nunderstand their outside world (Gleason, 2008). Table 20-2 \noffers ideas for play activities involving visual stimulation.\nSensory Processing Disorders\nIn sensory processing disorder (SPD), also known as \nsensory integration disorder or dysfunction, the process of \ntranslating all incoming sensory stimulation in a meaningful \ndecreasing exposure to bright light (even though there is \nno direct correlation between increased ROP incidence \nand lighting). Use of supplemental oxygen must be moni\u00ad\ntored and maintained according to saturation limits to \nhelp prevent fluctuations in blood oxygen levels. ROP \nshould be treated once diagnosis is confirmed by eye \nexam (NIH/NEI, 2016a).\nRetinoblastoma\nRetinoblastoma is a rare tumor of the retina that typi\u00ad\ncally affects children younger than 5 years of age. This \ncongenital ocular tumor is usually unilateral, although \n30% of tumors may be bilateral. Approximately 40% of \nretinoblastomas are inherited via a mutated gene that \nmay predispose them to other cancers later in life, such \nas melanoma, osteosarcoma, lung cancer, or breast cancer, \nparticularly if radiation therapy was part of their treat\u00ad\nment (American Cancer Society, 2015; NIH/NEI, 2016b). \nParents may seek medical treatment for their child after \ndiscovering a whitish glow in their young child\u2019s eye. \nThe term often used to describe this phenomenon is \n\u201ccat\u2019s eye\u201d; the medical term for this finding is leukocoria \n(Figure 20-4).\nRetinoblastoma typically manifests with two initial \nsigns: white eye reflex and strabismus. Redness and \npain, which are often seen associated with glaucoma, are \nalso potential symptoms. Definitive diagnosis is made \nthrough parent interview, ophthalmic exam, ultrasound, \nand computed tomography. Prognosis is positive, with \na 90% success rate after treatment. Treatment includes \nradiation, laser therapy, cryotherapy, and chemotherapy. \nIf required for containment or structural damage, the \nchild\u2019s eye may be removed (enucleation) and a prosthesis \nprovided (Hockenberry & Wilson, 2009). Blindness is a \nlate sign of this disorder.\nFigure 20-4\u2002 Leukocoria or cat\u2019s eye.\nCourtesy of National Cancer Institute (http://www.cancer.gov)\n\t\nSensory Processing Disorders\t\n289\n", "TABLE 20-2\u2003\nPlay Activities for Visual Stimulation of Different Age Groups\nInfant\n\u203a\u203a\nInfants are able to distinguish color differences beginning at 2\u20133 months of age.\n\u203a\u203a\nCaregivers should provide objects with high contrast such as black-and-white patterns, checkerboards, circles, and yellow-\nand-black patterns.\n\u203a\u203a\nCaregivers should bring their face to within 6\u201310 inches in front of the infant; play with the infant in this visual range and \nshow various facial expressions.\n\u203a\u203a\nWith infants between 4 and 7 months, shades of reds, blues, and yellow are most beneficial, along with complex patterns \nand shapes.\n\u203a\u203a\nProvide infants with large picture books, music boxes, mobiles hung over the crib, push\u2013pull toys, jack-in-the-boxes, and \nstrings of big colorful beads.\n\u203a\u203a\nPlay peek-a-boo with infants to increase object permanence.\nToddler\n\u203a\u203a\nPhysical growth and motor skills slow during the toddler period, but intellectual, social, and emotional development \nincreases.

In the 1970s, Jane Ayers, an occupational \ntherapist, identified sensory integration dysfunction as \nproblems in managing and translating sensory inputs \nobtained through the vestibular, proprioception, tactile, \nauditory, and visual senses.

They struggle to cope with everyday life \nactivities such as dressing, eating, and playing. Use of gross \nand fine motor skills, attention and behavior, self-esteem, \neating, and sleeping are all influenced by how the brain \ninterprets these incoming sensory signals. The senses help \nchildren interpret the world and adapt that understanding \n290\t\nChapter 20\u2003 Sensory Perceptions: Impairments and Disorders\n", "\u2022\t Praxis disorders: Problems with motor planning.

Sensory integration \ndifficulties may be a factor in autism spectrum disorders, \nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety/\nbehavioral disorders, and developmental dis-coordination \n(American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2012).\nSymptoms of SPD must be thoroughly evaluated to \nrule out behavioral, developmental, and medical disorders. \nIn addition, nurses should educate families that sensory \nintegration therapies have insufficient data to support \ntheir use as interventions, set time limits and specific goals \nand parameters when monitoring for effect of sensory \nintegration therapies, and recognize that occupational \ntherapy may be time limited depending on resources and \ninsurance, so that the plan of treatment must include clear \npriorities (AAP, 2012).\nAutism Spectrum Disorders\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a group of disorders \nthat affects brain development. As of 2013, the fifth edition \nof Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n(DSM-5) grouped subtypes of autism into ASD, including \n\u201cclassic autism disorder,\u201d childhood disintegration disorder, \npervasive developmental disorder\u2014not otherwise specified \n(PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome (Lai, Lombardo, \nChakrabarti, & Baron-Cohen, 2013).\nThe incidence of ASD is approximately 1 in 68 children, \nand 1 in 42 males; that is, boys are 5 times more likely to \nbe diagnosed with ASD than girls. Almost half of children \ncurrently diagnosed with ASD demonstrate average or \nabove-average intelligence, compared to one third of those \ndiagnosed a decade ago. Risk factors for ASD include low \nbirth weight, prematurity, having a sibling with ASD, and \ngenetic disorders such as fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, \nand tuberous sclerosis (Christensen et\u00a0al., 2016; National \nInstitute of Mental Health, 2016).\nIn 2000, the CDC established the Autism and Devel\u00ad\nopmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. \nThe primary goals were to accurately track the number \nof children with ASD, provide characteristics of ASD \n(including gender, race/ethnicity, age at evaluation and \ndiagnosis, and intellectual ability), determine whether \nASD is common in a particular group of children, and \nunderstand the impact of ASD on the child, family, and \ncommunity (CDC, 2016a).\nbased on their environment. Successful sensory interpreta\u00ad\ntion then increases self-esteem, confidence, and sense of \nidentity (Figure 20-5).\nIn contrast, poor integration of sensory input may dis\u00ad\ntract, confuse, and frustrate children with SPD, prompting \nthem to act out with inappropriate behavior in the class\u00ad\nroom and be labeled a \u201cproblem child.\u201d This labeling and \ncategorization can further alienate these children from their \npeers. Children with SPD may have difficulty academically \nand socially, leading to feelings of isolation; they may be \ndisruptive, confused, angry, and prone to behavioral out\u00ad\nbursts; and they may have a lack of physical coordination \nthat makes them reluctant to participate in sports. Such \nchildren may also underreact to sensory stimulation (e.g., \ntactile, vestibular, proprioception, hearing, vision, smell, \nand taste stimuli). As caregivers, teachers, and advocates, \nnurses need to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating \nenvironment to support every child\u2019s developing brain and \nbuild each child\u2019s trust in the world.\nThree major categories of sensory processing disorders \nare distinguished (Spiral Foundation, 2015):\n\u2022\t Sensory modulation dysfunction: Under- or \nover-response to stimulation, such as hypersensitiv\u00ad\nity to sounds, a tendency to be easily distracted by \nmovements, or overreaction to certain textures.\n\u2022\t Sensory discrimination disorder: Difficulty in \nrecognizing and processing sensations such as \ntouch. The child may have difficulty with balance \nand coordination, enjoy spinning around, chew on \n\u00adnonfood items, or grab items too tightly.\nFigure 20-5\u2002 Features of sensory processing disorder.\nSensory processing disorder\nSound can be\ntoo loud or too \ndistracting\nDoes not like to be\ntouched or wants to\ntouch everything\nMay f\nfabrics or all clothing \nuncomfortable\nCan be clumsy, \nuncoordinated, \nrunning into things\nMay react strongly \nto smells\nDifficulty processing\nverbal instructions\nMay have a limited \npalate and not \nenjoy certain tastes \nor textures\nind certain \n\t\nAutism Spectrum Disorders\t\n291\n", "behaviors. They may experience motor delays, leading to \nclumsiness or poor motor coordination. Delayed language \nor cognitive development is not usually part of the clinical \npicture of Asperger syndrome.\nTreatment Goals for ASD\nASD begins in early childhood but lasts throughout the \nlifetime. Therefore, diagnostic testing of developmental \ndelays should begin at 9 months and be repeated at 18 \nand 24 months, according to the recommendations of the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics. There is no single means \nof medical detection or cure for autism.\nChildren with ASD are often prone to associated medi\u00ad\ncal conditions, including seizures, sleep disturbances, and \ngastrointestinal disturbances such as constipation, diarrhea, \nand inflammatory bowel disease (Coury et\u00a0al., 2012). These \ndisorders must be treated with appropriate medical care \nin addition to therapy to address the child\u2019s neurologic \nand social dysfunctions. Sensory processing difficulties in \nchildren with ASD may cause them to be overly sensitive \nto textures or sounds, or not sensitive enough to lighting or \ntemperature. Early interventions (i.e., support for children \nand families that begins soon after birth, so as to minimize \nthe extent of the problem experienced by the young child) \nwill benefit these children over the long term, as they learn \nand build coping skills to deal with behavior and personal \nrelationships. Therapies will aid in decreasing symptoms and \nincrease capabilities in handling their environment. Treat\u00ad\nment plans must be individualized, as not every child has \nthe same set of symptoms or reactions to their surroundings.\nChildren with ASD may have varied characteristics in \ndifferent degrees that affect verbal and nonverbal com\u00ad\nmunication, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. \nASD is associated with problems in motor coordination, \nattention, physical health, and intellectual abilities. The \nwide and varied range of signs and symptoms of ASD in\u00ad\nclude not showing eye contact, crying outbursts, delayed \nlanguage, repetitive words or phrases, rocking, preoccupa\u00ad\ntion with lining up objects in a certain way, gastrointestinal \nsymptoms (constipation or diarrhea), seizure disorders, \naltered sleep patterns, sensory processing problems, and \neating nonfood items. Children and adults with ASD may \nbe of above-average intelligence, very detailed oriented, \nand able to retain information over a long period of time; \nbe strong visual and auditory learners; and excel in math, \nscience, music, or art (CDC, 2016b). Children with ASD \nalso have challenges with social interactions. They may \navert their gaze and not look at a person speaking to them. \nLanguage development may be delayed, and they may \ninterpret social or verbal cues incorrectly. Children with \nASD take language very literally and may not understand \nthe intent behind another person\u2019s use of language, such \nas with jokes or sarcasm. They may respond to stimuli by \nphysically hurting themselves through repetitive behaviors \nsuch as head banging or rocking to help them cope with \nsituations they do not understand (CDC, 2016b).\nAsperger syndrome falls under the broad category of \nASD. Children with Asperger syndrome are considered \nto have a high-functioning form of autism, as their dif\u00ad\nficulties usually involve social interactions and repetitive \nCase Study\nBaby JR is an ex-30 weeks\u2019 gestation male with multiple \nmedical issues during his 15-month hospitalization. JR\u2019s \nmother has type 1 diabetes, requiring multiple daily insulin \ninjections that continued during this pregnancy. Because of \nhis prematurity and immature lungs, this infant required a \ntracheostomy at 1 month of age, as well as diuretics, aerosol \ntreatments, and aminophylline to treat his chronic lung disease. \nA MIC-KEY button (gastrostomy tube) was surgically placed \nprior to discharge, as he had difficulty taking his required \ndaily nutrition orally.\nJR had several bouts of pneumonia during his hospital stay \nand developed septic shock and endocarditis from severe sep\u00ad\nsis.

Within the brain structures are \nneurons with myelin sheaths (not fully present until late \nadolescence), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meninges, and the \nventricles where the CSF is produced and reabsorbed by \nthe choroid plexus lining the four ventricles of the brain \n(Figure 21-2).\nThe outer layer of the brain, the cerebrum, is the largest \nbrain structure and is in control of motor, sensory, and \nintellectual functioning. The outermost layer is the cerebral \ncortex (gray matter), which is made up of neuron cell bodies. \nIn contrast, the inner layer of the cerebrum consists of the \nbasal ganglia and the axons (white matter). The cerebrum \nis divided into two hemispheres connected by the corpus \ncallosum, a fibrous band of nerves that share informa\u00ad\ntion between the hemispheres. The right side of the brain \ncontrols the left side of the body, and vice versa. Directly \nbelow the corpus callosum is the thalamus. Considered \nan information relay center, this tissue is responsible for \ntransporting information via nerves to the areas of the \ncerebrum. The cerebrum is also divided into four specific \nlobes, each with its own function: the temporal lobe (taste, \nhearing, and smell), the parietal lobe (sensory coordina\u00ad\ntion), the occipital lobe (visual stimuli interpretation), and \nthe frontal lobe (voluntary motor movements). Directly \nunder the thalamus is the hypothalamus, which provides \nautonomic brain regulation of sleep, appetite, blood pres\u00ad\nsure, core body temperature control, breathing patterns \nand depth, and peripheral nerve transmissions in response \nto emotions and behaviors.\nIntroduction\nThe concept of intracranial regulation is complex. The \nbony cranium houses a variety of neurologic structures \nthat require protection, regulation, and integration so that \nthey can provide the systems of the body with messages to \nmaintain homeostasis and functional status. Intracranial \nregulation requires that the central nervous system (the \ncommand center) and the peripheral nervous system \n(the response center) work together to support the child\u2019s \nmaturation, growth and development, cognitive develop\u00ad\nment, and safety through appropriate responses to harmful \nstimuli.\nNeurologic System Function\nUnderstanding the anatomy and physiology of the central \nand peripheral nervous system is the foundation for con\u00ad\nnecting symptoms with disorders or injuries. The entire \nnervous system must work cohesively to ensure normal \nfunction, sensory experiences, and involuntary and vol\u00ad\nuntary motor responses. The three core components of \nthe child\u2019s nervous system are the central nervous system \n(CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the \nautonomic (involuntary) nervous system (ANS). All three \nof these components must communicate, coordinate, and \ninteract appropriately to provide the child with full physi\u00ad\ncal, emotional, and intellectual properties and activities. \nThe central nervous system serves as the command center \nfor the entire nervous system, constantly interpreting and \nintegrating stimuli and initiating both voluntary and invol\u00ad\nuntary movements. The nervous system not only controls \nthe functions of the body, but allows for adaptation to the \nenvironment, both consciously and unconsciously.\nDevelopmental Factors\nNeurologic development begins in the fifth week of fetal \ndevelopment, with neurons (impulse conductor cells) even\u00ad\ntually being produced during weeks 15 to 30 of gestation. \nWith healthy and consistent development, the newborn \nbegins life with neurologic stability and predictable growth \nand maturity. The identification of lags in developmental \nmilestones is a key indicator that the child is experiencing \na neurologic disorder.\nCentral Nervous System\nThe central nervous system includes the brain and the \nspinal cord, which are housed in and protected by the bony \ncranium and the vertebral column, respectively. To provide \nroom for expansion of the brain, the newborn presents \nwith open anterior and posterior fontanels (Figure 21-1). \nFigure 21-1\u2002 Anterior and posterior fontanels on a newborn\u2019s skull. \nMetopic\nsuture\nCoronal\nsuture\nLambdoid\nsuture\nAnterior\nfontanel\nSagittal\nsuture\nPosterior\nfontanel\nAnterior\nPosterior\nNormal skull of the newborn\n296\t\nChapter 21\u2003 Intracranial Regulation\n", "Figure 21-2\u2002 The structures of the brain, protective coating, and the spinal cord.\nHypothalamus\nCerebrum\nCorpus\ncallosum\nSpinal cord\nCerebellum\nBrain\nstem\nPons\nMedulla\nThalamus\nSkin\nSkull\nDura\nmater\nArachnoid\nMeninges\nPia mater\nCerebral cortex\nWhite matter\nPeriosteal layer\nMeningeal layer\nCerebrum\nTemporal lobe\nParietal\nlobe\nFrontal\nlobe\nOccipital\nlobe\nBrain stem\nCerebellum\n\t\nDevelopmental Factors\t\n297\n", "\u2022\t Sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight): Re\u00ad\nleases adrenergic catecholamines to provide energy \nto respond to stressful stimuli\nCerebrospinal Fluid Regulation\nBoth acquired and congenital disorders can lead to the \ndysregulation of CSF. The overproduction of CSF, or \nthe decreased absorption of CSF, can lead to increased \nintracranial pressure (i.e., increased pressure inside the \nskull) in children whose fontanels and suture lines are \nclosed.\nThinking in Concepts to Promote \nSafety: Intracranial Regulation\nThe concept of intracranial regulation refers to the pro\u00ad\ncess of stabilization and homeostasis of the tissues and \nfluid present in the child\u2019s bony cranium. During insults \ndue to injury, trauma, infection, or space-occupying le\u00ad\nsions, the process of regulation will include stabilizing \npressure within the bony cranium. Many disorders and \ninjuries during childhood can lead to the dysregulation \nof, or increase in, intracranial pressure (ICP). Three com\u00ad\npensatory mechanisms serve to regulate the intracranial \nspace:\n\u2022\t The ability to decrease the production and increase \nthe absorption of CSF\nBelow the hypothalamus is the base of the brain, called \nthe cerebellum. The cerebellum regulates equilibrium, \nsmooth-muscle movements, sensory impulse coordination \nwith muscle activity, and muscle tone.\nThe most posterior segment of the brain is the brain \nstem. Here, information about the basic functions of the \nrespiratory, cardiac, and vasomotor systems are transmit\u00ad\nted between the higher levels of the brain and the body.\nThe most central anatomic components of the brain are \nthe neurons. Numbering in the hundreds of billions, these \ncells are considered conductor cells for nerve impulses.\nThe spinal cord, which is bathed in CSF, consists of a \ncentral band of tissue, with 31 pairs of spinal nerves ex\u00ad\ntending from this cord. Ascending tracts are considered \nsensory (toward the brain), whereas descending tracts are \nreserved for motor responses to stimuli.\nIn summary, one can think of the head as a vault con\u00ad\ntaining many vital structures. The brain occupies 80% \nof the space in the cranium, cerebral blood flow accounts \nfor 10% of the cranial volume, and CSF fills the remaining \n10%. Box 21-1 provides information on head circumfer\u00ad\nence in children.\nBOX 21-1\u2002 Head Circumference Measurements\nHead circumference measurements are essential for monitoring \nbrain growth and should continue from birth to at least the \nsecond birthday. Normal patterns of growth are as follows:\n\u2022\t At birth, the average head circumference is 34 to 35\u00a0cm.\n\u2022\t From birth to 1 year of age, the head circumference \ngrows by 2 cm per month for the first 3 months, by \n1 cm per month for the next 3 months, and by 3 cm \ntotal over the last 6 months. Thus, head circumference \nincreases, on average, by 12 cm during the first year \nof life.\n\u2022\t From 1 year to 3 years of age, head circumference \ngrowth slows, averaging only 1 to 3 cm per year.\n\u2022\t The average head circumference for 12-month-olds is \napproximately 45 to 47 cm.\n\u2022\t By age 3, the head circumference measurement aver\u00ad\nages 48.5 cm.\n\u2022\t More than 50% of brain growth occurs during the first \n12 months of life.\nData from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center \nfor Health Statistics.

Specifically, research \nhas shown that the brain\u2019s physiology is governed by a rule \nconcerning space and pressure, which must remain consistent \nand stable. If any of the three elements of fixed space\u2014\nbrain tissue, blood circulation, or CSF\u2014is altered, the fixed \nbony cranium must activate compensatory mechanisms by \naltering one of these three components to maintain normal \nand expected levels of intracranial pressure (Dunn, 2002; \nKukreti, Mohseni-Bod, & Drake,\u00a02014).\nPeripheral Nervous System\nStructures of the peripheral nervous system include those \nneurologic structures that are outside of the brain and spi\u00ad\nnal cord.

Both \nthe autonomic nervous system and the somatic (voluntary) \nnervous system are a part of the PNS. The somatic nervous \nsystem regulates higher brain processing, reflexes, shivering, \nand all conscious thought. The autonomic nervous system \nregulates two antagonistic systems:\n\u2022\t Parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest): \nReleases the cholinergic neurohormone acetylcho\u00ad\nline to conserve energy\n298\t\nChapter 21\u2003 Intracranial Regulation\n", "TABLE 21-1\u2003\nCranial Nerves Mnemonic\nCranial Nerves\nMnemonic: \u201cOn old Olympic towering tops, a \nFinn and German viewed some hops.\u201d \nI Olfactory: Sense of smell\nOn\nII Optic: Visual sensory\nOld \nIII Oculomotor: Extraocular eye movements, upper eyelid elevation, \npapillary construction\nOlympic\nIV Trochlear: Extraocular eye movement, inferior\nTowering\nV Trigeminal: Jaw movements including chewing, biting\nTops\nVI Abducens: Extraocular eye movements, lateral\nA \nVII Facial: Sense of taste in anterior area of the tongue, muscle \nmovement of\u00a0expressions, forehead muscle movement\nFinn \nVIII Acoustic: Auditory sensory\nAnd \nIX Glossopharyngeal: Swallowing ability and coordination, throat \nsensations and taste in the posterior portion of the tongue\nGerman \nX Vagus: Gag reflex, swallowing, abdominal and thoracic visceral \nmovements\nViewed \nXI Spinal accessory: Ability to move head and shoulders, rotation of \nthe\u00a0head\nSome\nXII Hypoglossal: Tongue movements\nHops\nFigure 21-3\u2002 The cranial nerves.\nOlfactory bulb (olfactory\nnerves [I] enter bulb)\nOptic nerve (II)\nOculomotor nerve (III)\nTrochlear nerve (IV)\nTrigeminal nerve (V)\nAbducens nerve (VI)\nFacial nerve (VII)\nVestibulocochlear\nnerve (VIII)\nGlossopharyngeal\nnerve (IX)\nVagus nerve (X)\nSpinal accessory nerve (XI)\nHypoglossal nerve (XII)\nCerebellum\nMedulla\nPons\nPituitary\ngland\n\t\nThinking in Concepts to Promote Safety: Intracranial Regulation\t\n299\n", "immediate ICP monitoring in an intensive care unit, and \nwill require intubation for respiratory support.

Indeed, \ntraumatic brain injury (TBI) associated with childhood \ninjuries and trauma is a significant cause of morbidity and \nmortality in children both in the United States and around \nthe world. The three principal causes of TBI in children \nare motor vehicle accidents, falls, and intentional injury \nby assault (child abuse); the last type of trauma is associ\u00ad\nated with more severe injuries (Deans, Minneci, Lowell, & \nGroner, 2013).\nWhen a child presents with increasing head circumference \nmeasurements, bulging fontanels, misshapen skull bones, \nirritability, vomiting, increased muscle tone, decreased \nor altered consciousness, or the setting-sun eyes sign, the \npediatric medical team should assess for the presence of \nincreased ICP. Increased ICP can be caused by a rise in \nthe pressure of the ventricles where CSF is produced and \nabsorbed, or it can stem from the presence of a lesion such \nas a tumor, infectious mass, bleed, clot, or brain tissue \nswelling. Medical diagnoses such as meningitis, stroke, \nhydrocephalus, encephalitis, and aneurysm rupture can \nincrease ICP as well. Rapid assessment, confirmation, and \nmedical treatment are warranted in children who present \nwith symptoms of increased ICP.\nIncreased ICP is directly related to decreased brain \ntissue perfusion and brain tissue anoxia. In many cases, it \nrepresents a secondary brain injury after a child has suf\u00ad\nfered a traumatic brain injury via a significant head trauma.\nAssessments for Increased ICP\nSymptoms of increased ICP in infants include altered level \nof consciousness; separation of the bony cranium sutures; \nnonpulsating, bulging fontanels; and projectile vomiting and \nirritability with inconsolability and a shrill, high-pitched cry. \nIn older children, vomiting, headache, lethargy, weakness, \ndiplopia, and seizures can denote increased ICP. Infants \nmay display Macewen sign, also known as cracked pot sign, \nin which an obvious enlarged venous system appears on \nthe top of the head (Figure 21-4).\nTo assess this condition, the medical team will order a \nlumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or \ncomputed tomography (CT), or placement of an intraven\u00ad\ntricular catheter, which is inserted into the ventricle through \na small hole drilled in the skull for pressure readings. If a \nchild\u2019s Glasgow Coma Scale score (discussed in detail later \nin this chapter) is between 3 and 8, the child must undergo \nFigure 21-4\u2002 Macewen sign.\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nN\normal values for ICP vary depending on the child\u2019s age. \nFor infants, ICP should be between 1.5 and 6 mm Hg; \nyoung children should have ICP between 3 and 7 mm Hg; \nand older children and young adults should have ICP \nreadings between 10 and 15 mm Hg. When a child expe\u00ad\nriences increased ICP with pressure readings exceeding \n20\u00a0mm Hg for more than 5 minutes, the child will need \nto be treated to prevent morbidity (Kukreti et\u00a0al., 2014).\nMedical Treatments for Increased ICP\nMedical treatment of a child with suspected increased \nICP starts with the identification of the associated trauma \nand stabilization of the injury. If rapid reduction of ICP \nis required, the pediatric team should administer medi\u00ad\ncations to sedate and/or intubate the child, perform \nprocedures to drain cerebrospinal fluid, and administer \nosmotherapy to pull fluids from the child\u2019s body. Intuba\u00ad\ntion criteria for increased ICP in the setting of traumatic \nbrain injury include hypoxia, hypocapnia, hypercarbia, \nchest wall dysfunction, and a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale \nscore (Kukreti et\u00a0al., 2014).\n300\t\nChapter 21\u2003 Intracranial Regulation\n", "Nursing Care of the Child with Increased ICP\nCaring for a child who has experienced a traumatic brain \ninjury or a pathological condition where the production \nor absorption of CSF is dysfunctional requires specialized \ntraining. The pediatric nurse will provide protection from \nharm, protection from infection during ICP monitoring, \nand care of the intubated child. The height of bed is raised \nto 30 degrees, the child\u2019s head is maintained in a midline \nposition, and the child\u2019s airway is maintained. The child\u2019s \npain and anxiety levels (if the child is not sedated) should \nbe a priority, as both of these factors can increase cerebral \nmetabolic demand. Maintaining a calm environment, \nreducing coughing, and reducing discomfort and sensory \nstimuli will assist the pediatric patient in maintaining a \nlower ICP.\nParents of a child with increased ICP will be in distress \nand need supportive nursing care. A social worker should \nSome institutions have established policies on hyper\u00ad\nventilation as a rapid means to reduce ICP. Hyperventila\u00ad\ntion is reserved for cases in which acute brain herniation \nis a risk, as this procedure can reduce brain oxygenation \n(Brasher & Tasker, 2013). Because Pco2 acts as a vaso\u00ad\nconstrictor when hyperemia is present, hyperventilation \nis undertaken to reduce Pco2 and increase blood flow in \nthe child\u2019s brain.\nThe goal of medication therapy for increased ICP is \nto maintain the child\u2019s osmolality to 360 mOsm/L. The \nfollowing medications are indicated for this purpose:\n\u2022\t Mannitol 5% to 20% IV, to reduce vascular \nvolume (net reduction of brain water) (0.25 to \n1 g/kg IV bolus)\n\u2022\t Pentobarbital (nembutal sodium), as barbiturates \nreduce intracranial hypertension and decrease cere\u00ad\nbral metabolic rates\n\u2022\t Osmitrol 5% intravenously, to provide the maximal \nvascular osmolality\n\u2022\t Hypertonic saline, to shift fluids out of brain tissue \nwithout inducing profound osmotic diuresis\nBEST PRACTICES\nH\nypotonic solutions should not be used in patients who \nhave experienced a traumatic brain injury resulting in \nincreased ICP, as extracellular fluid (ECF) shifts to intracellular \nfluid (ICF) compartments will occur, leading to greater brain \ntissue edema.\nFigure 21-5\u2002 Placement of a ventricular-peritoneal shunt.\nVentricular\ncatheter\nTubing in\nperitoneal\ncavity\nOther procedures used to rapidly reduce ICP include \nplacing the child in a barbiturate coma, implementing a \ndecompressive craniectomy (skull bone removal to pro\u00ad\nvide room for brain swelling), and use of hypothermia to \n32\u201233\u00b0C (which provides neuroprotection by reducing \ncerebral metabolism). After stabilization associated with a \ntraumatic brain injury or a documented increase in produc\u00ad\ntion of or lack of absorption of CSF, the child\u2019s condition \nmay require surgical placement of a shunt to remove CSF \nfrom the ventricles of the brain.\nVentricular-Peritoneal Shunts\nShunt placement consists of the surgical implantation of a \ndrainage system that extends from the inner cavity of one \nof the larger brain ventricles, down to the child\u2019s peritoneal \ncavity (Figure 21-5). The shunt provides for gravity-induced \ndrainage of excessive CSF causing increased intracranial \npressure. Nursing care includes daily measurement of head \ncircumference, protection from postoperative infection, \nand early identification of shunt failure by monitoring for \nsigns of increased ICP.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nW\nhen a child with a ventricular-peritoneal (VP) shunt \nexperiences a sudden onset of symptoms associated \nwith increasing ICP (e.g., projectile vomiting, headaches, \nfussiness, inconsolable crying), the nurse should suspect a \nshunt complication. Such complications can include kinking \nof the tubing leading to obstruction, clogging of the shunt \ntubing by infection or cellular debris, and disconnection \nof the tubing or migration of the tips of the tubing as the \nchild grows.\n\t\nThinking in Concepts to Promote Safety: Intracranial Regulation\t\n301\n", "nurse, or other members of the pediatric healthcare \nteam, can use this scale to test the child\u2019s best response \nto motor movement, verbal response, and eye opening. \nUnique to pediatrics, this scale does not require that \nthe child be able to verbalize his or her response; that \nis, the adult version of the Glasgow Coma Scale was \nmodified to allow even preverbal children to be tested \nwith this tool.\nScores on the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale range \nfrom 3 to 15.

A comprehensive assessment \nshould include a mental status exam as well as assessments \nof motor function, sensory function, cranial nerve func\u00ad\ntion, and reflexes. The pediatric nurse must assemble the \nequipment needed to successfully assess a child\u2019s neurologic \nstatus. Depending on the practice setting, various supplies \nshould be readily available for the healthcare team to use.\nIn practice, neurologic assessments usually focus on \nthe problem or concern presented by the child. It is more \ntypical for the pediatric nurse to be ready to check pupil \nreaction with a pen light, a full set of vital signs, motor \nfunction assessment, sensory function assessment, and \nlevel of consciousness assessment.\nPediatric Glasgow Coma Scale\nA frequently used rapid test of a child\u2019s neurologic status \nis the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (Figure 21-6).

The following tests are often used in children \nto determine pathology.\n\u2022\t Electroencephalogram (EEG): EEG is a measure\u00ad\nment of electrical activity within the brain to assess \nthe location and severity of seizure activity. It is \nusually conducted over a 24-hour period and uses a \nvideo to capture activity.\n\u2022\t Lumbar puncture: Sterile placement of a needle \ninto the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spi\u00ad\nnal column (L3\u20124 or L4\u20125) may be performed \nto obtain specimens, assess level of pressure, \nand administer medications such as intrathecal \nchemotherapy.\n\u2022\t MRI of the head: MRI, a noninvasive diagnostic \nprocedure without ionizing radiation, is used to \nevaluate the brain, CNS, and bones, and to look for \nmasses, tumors, and lesions.\nPrimitive Reflexes\n\u2022\t Babinski reflex: Assesses for pyramidal tract dys\u00ad\nfunction, with the infant dorsiflexing the great toe \nand then quickly fanning out the toes. This reflex \nmay be present up to 1 year of age.\n\u2022\t Moro reflex: Change in equilibrium when the head \nfalls back slightly (no more than 3 to 5 cm); the \ninfant will open the hands, extend and abduct the \narms, and then bring them back together. This re\u00ad\nflex disappears by 6 months of age.\n\u2022\t Tonic neck reflex/fencer\u2019s stance: With a slight \nmovement of the infant\u2019s head to either side while \nlying supine, the child will extend the arm and leg \nout on the side where the head was turned, mim\u00ad\nicking a fencer\u2019s pose. This reflex disappears by \n6 to 7 months of age.\n\u2022\t Dancing reflex: Placing supportive hands on the \nnewborn\u2019s chest wall, and then holding the infant \nwith feet just touching a surface, causes the child to \ndisplay small dancing movements.\n\u2022\t Crawling reflex: When the newborn is placed \nprone, the infant makes slight crawling movements.\n\u2022\t Startle reflex: When a newborn or young infant \nhears a sudden sound, the child will display the \nsame signs as noted with the Moro reflex.\n\u2022\t Sucking reflex: Assesses afferent fibers of cranial \nnerves V and IX, and efferent fibers of cranial \nnerves VII, IX, and XII.\nDeep Tendon Reflexes\nDeep tendon reflexes test the efferent neurons in the ante\u00ad\nrior horn of the spinal cord. Hyperreflexia may indicate a \nlesion above the level of the spinal reflex pathway, whereas \nhyporeflexia is a diminished response to the tapping of \nthe area and can also indicate disease. The following deep \ntendon reflexes are typically tested:\n\u2022\t Biceps reflex (C5\u20136)\n\u2022\t Brachioradialis reflex (C5\u20136)\n\u2022\t Knee jerk reflex or patellar (L2\u20134)\n\u2022\t Ankle jerk reflex (S1\u20132)\nReflexes are never used by themselves as a diagnostic tool \nfor neurologic health or disease, but rather are considered \npart of a more extensive assessment for neurologic health \nor problems. Deep tendon reflexes are graded using a 0 to \n4+ scale, where 0 is an absence of reflex response and 4+ \nindicates a clonus type of reaction with repeating reflex \ndemonstration.

Abusive head trauma is associated with high morbid\u00ad\nity and mortality. Leaving few external signs, the injury is \nmultifactorial and includes retinopathy (diagnostic marker), \n\u2022\t Positron emission tomography (PET) scan: PET \nscan is used to detect tumors, lesions, and trauma. \nRadioactive chemicals are administered and then \ntracked to detect abnormalities.\n\u2022\t Electromyography: This technology, which \nrecords electrical activity during muscle rest and \nactivity, is used to diagnose nerve and muscle \ndisorders.\n\u2022\t Nerve conduction velocity: This test measures the \nability of a nerve to send an electrical conduction \nvia flat electrodes; one electrode sends a signal \nto the nerve, and the other detects the muscle \nresponse.\n\u2022\t Ventricular tap: Needle placement into an infant\u2019s \nbulging fontanel is directed at the subdural space or \nthe ventricle via the anterior fontanel. This method \nis used to find an etiology for excessive head growth \nand increased ICP.\n\u2022\t ICP monitoring: This process allows for the assess\u00ad\nment of pressure readings (20 mm Hg or higher) \nwithin the ventricles through subarachnoid bolts or \nintraventricular catheter placement.\n\u2022\t Laboratory analysis: Lab tests may assess for spi\u00ad\nnal infections, inflammation (C-reactive protein \n[CRP] or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), \ninfection (blood cultures), urinalysis, serum lev\u00ad\nels of anticonvulsants, toxins and illicit drugs, \ncomplete blood cell count (CBC) with differentia\u00ad\ntion of the white blood cell (WBC) count, viral \ncultures for meningitis, metabolic testing for pro\u00ad\ntein disorders, and genetic testing for neurologic \ndisorders.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nC\nhildren and their families need support and education \nconcerning lumbar punctures. Children undergoing this \nprocedure should be kept with their parents if possible. Some \nchildren will require sedation for the procedure. They need \nto be positioned carefully for maximal success in accessing \nthe subarachnoid space with a long needle\u2014that is, in fetal \nposition in a tightly held curl (Figure 21-7), or sitting up \nwhile bending over as far as possible to obtain a forward \nflexion to maximize access of the lumbar vertebral column \n(Figure 21-8). Children should have maximum protection \nfrom injury, support for the discomfort associated with the \nspinal needle insertion (use lidocaine or another topical agent \nat least 45 minutes prior to the procedure at the needle \nsite), encouragement to drink fluids after the procedure, and \nmaintenance of a supine position for several hours after the \nprocedure to prevent a post-procedure spinal headache.\nFigure 21-7\u2002 An infant in a fetal position, held tightly in a curl, for \noptimal positioning during a lumbar puncture.\nFigure 21-8\u2002 A school-age child sitting up and flexed forward, ready \nfor a lumbar puncture.\n304\t\nChapter 21\u2003 Intracranial Regulation\n", "Risk Factors\nOccurring in all social, ethnic, and economic strata, \nabusive head trauma is associated with parental stressors \nincluding alcohol use, drug abuse, disability of the child, \nteenage parenting, and violent tendencies of the caregiver \n(Matschke et\u00a0al., 2009). Unrealistic expectations, single \nparenthood, instability of the home life, parental depres\u00ad\nsion, and maltreatment history of the parent are other risk \nfactors (Paul & Adamo, 2014).\nMedical Treatment\nTreatment for abusive head trauma is supportive. Children \nmay need to be intubated and monitored for increased ICP \nin the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The sequence \nof medical management is to initiate vital life support, \nsuspect that the child has been shaken, investigate for \nretinal bleeds, conduct diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT), \nand involve social services and law enforcement agencies \n(Christian, 2016).\nUnderstanding the long-term consequences of abusive \nhead trauma, which may include blindness, cognitive \nimpairment, learning disabilities, seizure disorders, motor \ndysfunction, cerebral palsy, and hydrocephalus, can assist \nthe medical team in providing supportive care.\nNursing Care\nThe most important aspect of nursing care is prevention \nof abusive head trauma. Nurses are in the ideal position \nto offer preventive education to families being discharged \nfrom maternity units, nurseries, neonatal intensive care \nunits (NICUs), and pediatric clinics. Understanding that \nchildren younger than 3 to 4 years are at highest risk for \nchild abuse, nurses must develop educational programs \nthat address the prevention and consequences of child \nabuse. Physical vulnerabilities of children must be com\u00ad\nmunicated, such as their disproportionally larger heads, \nweak neck muscles, and inability to communicate needs. \nInconsolable crying, male sex, colic, increased medical \nneeds, and prematurity are all factors that put a child at \nrisk for abusive head trauma (Walls, 2006).\nshearing of the brain vasculature, subdural hemorrhages \n(diagnostic marker), diffuse brain tissue injury, respiratory \ndistress, and increased ICP. Children may present with \nparalysis, coma, and multiple fractures. A single vigorous \nshaking episode of an infant or young child can lead to \nlong-term consequences or death (AAP, 2015).\nThe injury associated with abusive head trauma is \ndescribed as being a whiplash type of injury. During the \nshaking episode, the child\u2019s brain experiences an abrupt \nand uncontrolled coup\u2012contrecoup injury through an \naccelerated, then decelerated movement of the brain \nin the cranium, with or without a rotator component. \nThese injuries are also described as translational forces \nproducing linear movement of the brain (Frasier & Coats, \n2015). Impact injuries may be noted as well. If impact \ninjuries are present, the severity of the consequences of \nabusive head trauma increases. Central apnea associated \nwith extension of the medulla oblongata, mostly associ\u00ad\nated with severe shaking, can be fatal. Death is reported \nin as many as 36% of severe abusive head trauma cases \n(Matschke et\u00a0al., 2009).\nDiagnosis\nRadiographic and ophthalmologic findings are used to \nconfirm a diagnosis of abusive head trauma (Frasier & \nCoats, 2015). \u201cFlame-like\u201d hemorrhages of the retina \n(Figure 21-9), bleeding in the optic nerve, and swelling of \nthe eye structures are confirmatory findings (AAP, 2015). \nSubdural hematoma (SDH) is not exclusively seen in abuse \ncases, but the presence of SDH is strongly associated with \ncases of abuse (AAP, 2015), but not with accidental injury. \nThus, if SDH is present, the possibility of abuse should be \nconsidered. Children who present with respiratory distress \nwith no obvious adventitious breath sounds should also \nbe considered for abusive head trauma.\nFigure 21-9\u2002 \u201cFlame-like\u201d retinal hemorrhages indicative of abusive \nhead trauma.\n\u00a9 Michael Abbey/Science Source\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nI\nn a clinical trial, educational materials were deemed \neffective in improving parental understanding of general \ncrying, unsoothable crying, dangers of shaking, and behav\u00ad\niors of walking away when frustrated and caregiver self-talk \n(Barr et\u00a0al., 2008).

Medication classes \nused for this purpose include ampicillins, cephalosporins, \naminoglycosides, and penicillins. Intravenous or oral \ncorticosteroids may be used on a trial basis to reduce \ninflammation and prevent complications such as hearing \nloss. If the meningitis is determined to have a viral etiol\u00ad\nogy, the treatment is supportive, including bed rest, fluids, \nanalgesics, and infection precautions.\nMeningitis\nThree primary layers of connective tissue surround and \nprotect the brain. The dura mater, the thickest protective \nlayer, lines the skull bones and folds into the brain fissures \nto provide protection and stability. The arachnoid mem\u00ad\nbrane, the middle protective layer, is much thinner and \nmore fragile. The final layer, closest to the brain tissue, is \nthe pia mater; this layer is extremely thin and very vascular. \nCollectively, these layers are referred to as the meninges. \nInflammation or infection of these layers, called meningitis, \ncan be viral, bacterial, or aseptic in nature.\nDiagnosis\nPrior to administering antibiotic therapy to a pediatric \npatient, it is important for the healthcare team to collect \nblood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid via a lumbar puncture \n(Bonadio, 2014). Bacterial meningitis can be caused by a \nvariety of microbes, but the two most commonly isolated \nin children are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria \nmeningitidis. In the past, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type B (Hib), and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus \nalso were common culprits. E. coli infection has until fairly \nrecently been easily managed with beta-lactam antibiot\u00ad\nics, so E. coli meningitis has become unusual (although \ngrowing antibiotic resistance may change that status), \nwhile effective vaccines have reduced the incidence of HiB- \nand beta-hemolytic Streptococcus\u2012related cases (Brouwer, \nTunkel, & van de Beek, 2010; Pe\u00f1a et\u00a0al., 2008).\nRisk Factors\nChildren may be exposed to bacteria that reach the \nmeninges via bloodstream infections. When a child has \nbacterial otitis media, sinusitis, mastoiditis, or pharyngitis, \nthe bacteria can enter the bloodstream and directly infect \nthe meninges. Bacterial meningitis can progress into the \nCSF, which includes few WBCs, and flourish to the point \nthat it becomes a very significant and potentially lethal \ninfection. Children who are on long-term corticosteroids \nor who are immunosuppressed are particularly vulnerable \nto complicated meningitis. Meningitis is associated with \nthe following signs and symptoms:\n\u2022\t Vomiting\n\u2022\t Fever\n\u2022\t Irritability, exacerbated by cuddling and close hold\u00ad\ning or rocking\n\u2022\t Nuchal rigidity (pain and resistance to neck \nflexion)\n\u2022\t Change in eating or feeding patterns\n\u2022\t Headache\n\u2022\t Lethargy\n\u2022\t Seizures\nFigure 21-11\u2002 Brudzinski\u2019s sign.\nFigure 21-10\u2002 Kernig\u2019s sign.\n306\t\nChapter 21\u2003 Intracranial Regulation\n", "pediatric oncologists and clinics that pool their data to \nsupport assessment of treatment regimens and data col\u00ad\nlection and analysis of outcomes.\nNursing Care\nNursing care includes assessment for and immediate report\u00ad\ning of complications associated with the presence of the \ntumor and the treatment of the tumor. A space-occupying \nlesion can lead to increased ICP, neurologic symptoms, and \ndiscomfort. The nurse should monitor for pain, nausea and \nvomiting (especially on rising in the morning), changes in \nvisual acuity, diminishing productivity at school (e.g., due \nto tumor-induced strabismus and nystagmus), personal\u00ad\nity changes, increasing head circumference, ataxia, and \nclumsiness. Children with brain tumors should be placed \non seizure precautions and assisted with ambulation until \nindependence is fully assessed. Safety is key for a child with \na neurologic tumor.\nIf a child has undergone a surgical biopsy or resection \nof the tumor, immediate postoperative needs include bed \nrest with the head of the bed elevated by 10 to 20 degrees \nfor several hours. Postoperative pain assessments, neuro\u00ad\nlogic status, vital signs, mental status, and emotional status \nshould all be evaluated.\nNursing Care\nChildren who present with symptoms of meningitis should \nbe immediately placed on droplet and contact precau\u00ad\ntions. Isolation precautions should be maintained for no \nless than 24 hours of intravenous antibiotic therapy. All \nspecimens should be collected before the administration \nof antibiotics. The child should be kept at rest, with lower \nstimulation; specifically, lights should be kept low and \nnoise should be minimized.\nBrain Tumors\nAs the most common solid tumors found across childhood, \nbrain tumors have the highest rates of mortality of any of \nthe childhood malignancies (Ward, DeSantis, Robbins, \nKohler, & Jemal, 2014). The vast majority of brain tumors \nare located in the supratenortial region (above the cerebel\u00ad\nlum). The etiology of most childhood brain tumors remains \nunknown. Fourteen types of brain tumors are distinguished, \nbased on the tumor histology (tissue type). The most \ncommon brain tumors in children are medulloblastoma, \nependymoma, and astrocytoma (American Brain Tumor \nAssociation, 2014). There are no known risk factors for \ndevelopment of childhood brain tumors.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of brain tumors includes recent medical his\u00ad\ntory, neurologic examination, and diagnostic procedures. \nChildren may report vomiting and nausea, especially upon \nrising in the morning and resolving after vomiting, and \nheadaches. Neurologic symptoms may include tingling, \nweakness, abnormal paresthesia, trouble walking or bal\u00ad\nance issues, and vision, hearing, and speech problems. \nBrain MRI with gadolinium injection, CT, and PET scans \nare most frequently ordered to assess for brain tumors. A \nlumbar puncture is performed to determine whether the \ndisease has spread to the CSF or surrounding cord tissues. \nIf the child presents with back pain or pain that extends \nfrom the back out the arms or down the legs, spinal me\u00ad\ntastasis is suspected.\nMedical Treatment\nTreatment for brain tumors is complicated. The child might \ninitially undergo a tumor biopsy so definitive histology \ncan be determined. The child typically will have a tumor \nresection if able, or a tumor reduction if the tumor is not \nresectable. If the tissue type is radiosensitive, radiation \ntreatment is administered over the course of several weeks. \nThe total radiation dose is determined and then divided \nbased the desired treatment length. Chemotherapy may be \nincluded with treatment. Treatment protocols may follow \nguidelines provided by organizations such as the Children\u2019s \nOncology Group (COG), an international consortium of \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nI\nn the immediate postoperative period for a child undergoing \nsurgical manipulation of a brain tumor, the nurse must be \ncautious not to contribute to increased ICP. The nurse should \ntreat pain immediately, never place the child in a Trendelen\u00ad\nburg position, monitor for hyperthermia associated with brain \nedema, and keep the child comfortable and calm.\nChildren with brain tumors and their families need very \nspecial and empathetic nursing care. These children may \nundergo many months or years of treatments, surgeries, \nand diagnostics. Support and hope are needed to assist the \nfamily in tolerating the multiple healthcare interactions \nand facing the unknowns associated with whether their \nchild can be cured.\nSeizure Disorders\nSeizure disorders occur when a wave of abnormal and \nexcessive electrical activity in a child\u2019s brain causes changes \nin motor movements, levels of awareness, and behavior. \nThe term epilepsy is used to denote a tendency to have \nrecurrent seizures. The term convulsion is sometimes \nused to describe a grand mal, tonic\u2012clonic seizure. Severe \nseizure activity can be very frightening to parents, as the \nchild may lose consciousness, experience uncontrollable \n\t\nDefinitions of Neurologic Impairments or Disorders\t\n307\n", "jerking movements, froth at the mouth with excessive \nsaliva, and bite the tongue.\nNumerous etiologies are associated with childhood \nseizure activity, but the majority of children who have an \nepileptic disorder have no identifiable cause. Eighty-percent \nof seizures that occur in the first year of life have no etiol\u00ad\nogy that can be isolated in diagnostic exams or laboratory \nanalysis. Across childhood, seizures can be associated with \noverall or diffuse brain dysfunction such as occurs with \nrapid-onset high fevers, exposure to toxins, exposure to \ndrugs, neoplasms or tumors, space-occupying lesions, \nhypertension, or bleeds.\nDiagnosis\nA 24-hour EEG with video is the cornerstone of diagnos\u00ad\ning seizures not associated with fevers in children. Either \nan MRI or a CT may also be performed in an attempt to \ndetect the presence of brain abnormalities predisposing \nthe child to the erratic electrical currency generated in \nthe brain that leads to seizure activity. Table 21-2 identi\u00ad\nfies the international classifications used for childhood \nepileptic seizures.\nRisk Factors\nRisk factors for children presenting with seizures include a \nvariety of pathologies, trauma, injuries, and bleeds. Periods \nof anoxia to the brain are associated with the development \nof seizure activity.\nMedical Treatment\nCurrent medications administered to children include \nsingle-medication regimens as well as multidrug regimens \nfor nonresponsive patients or in case of continued seizure \nactivity. Box 21-2 summarizes the medications used for \ntreating pediatric seizures.\nSingle concussions are considered to produce a transient \nbrain injury; subsequent concussions can increase the \nrisk for greater neurodegenerative impairment, including \nmemory loss, traumatic encephalopathy, post-traumatic \nstress disorder, and cognitive defects. Due to the potential \nshort- and long-term effects of a repeat concussion (par\u00ad\nticularly if the first one is incompletely healed), children \nwho suffer from a concussion should be protected from \na recurrence until a doctor\u2019s examination pronounces the \nfirst incident completely resolved (Harmon et\u00a0al., 2013).\nConcussion symptoms are organized into four categories: \nthinking/remembering, physical, emotional/mood, and \nsleep (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], \n2016a). The first category includes difficulty concentrating, \nthinking clearly, or remembering new information, and can \nbe expressed as \u201cfeeling slow.\u201d Physical symptoms include \ndizziness, poor balance, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, \nphotophobia, and poor coordination. Emotional or mood \nsymptoms include anxiety, irritability, and depression. Sleep \ndisturbances may range from insomnia to hypersomnia, \nor involve difficulty falling asleep. Loss of consciousness is \nnot needed to make a diagnosis of a concussion. Symptoms \nTABLE 21-2\u2003\nInternational Classification of Seizures\nPartial Seizures\n\u203a\u203a\nSimple partial seizures\n\u203a\u203a\nComplex partial seizures\nGeneralized Seizures\n\u203a\u203a\nAbsence seizures: Most often noted in a child\u2019s \nclassroom, when the child \u201cchecks out\u201d and is \nnonresponsive for a brief period \n\u203a\u203a\nAtonic seizures: Noted as an abrupt loss of the child\u2019s \nmuscle tone\n\u203a\u203a\nMyoclonic seizures: Brief, symmetrical, repetitive \nmovements\n\u203a\u203a\nClonic seizures: Jerking, rhythmic muscle movements, \nsuch as flexion of the child\u2019s extremities\n\u203a\u203a\nTonic seizures: Sustained muscular contraction\n\u203a\u203a\nTonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizure): Combination \nof abnormal muscular activity including tonic (sustained \ncontraction) and clonic (jerking movements) features\n\u203a\u203a\nFebrile seizures: Seizure that occurs in children ranging \nfrom 3 months to 6 years of age, which is not classified \nas an epileptic seizure disorder. Fevers that have rapid \nonset, but are not always high, can cause a child to have \na generalized grand mal seizure lasting 1\u20132 minutes. \nFebrile seizures have familial tendencies and lower \nthe threshold for subsequent fever-induced seizure \nactivity. Anticonvulsants are rarely ordered for children \nwho experience such seizures; treatment is preventive, \nthrough the administration of antipyretics at the onset \nof a suspected febrile illness and on an around-the-clock \nbasis until the illness ends.\nBOX 21-2\u2002 Medications for Treatment of Seizures in Children\n\u2022\t Carbamazepine (Tegretol or Carbatrol)\n\u2022\t Clonazepam (Klonopin)\n\u2022\t Ethosuximide (Zarontin)\n\u2022\t Lamotrigine (Lamictal)\n\u2022\t Levetiracetam (Keppra)\n\u2022\t Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)\n\u2022\t Phenobarbital (Luminal)\n\u2022\t Phenytoin (Dilantin)\n\u2022\t Tiagabine (Gabitril)\n\u2022\t Topiramate (Topamax)\n\u2022\t Valproic acid (Depakote or Depakene)\nData from Goldenberg, M.

HLA testing may be suggested \nfor children in higher-risk ethnic groups (Schachter, 2016).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nF\namilies of children who are prescribed phenytoin need \neducation on the side effects of gingival hypertro\u00ad\nphy, rash, folic acid depletion, and increased body hair \n(Schachter, 2016).\n308\t\nChapter 21\u2003 Intracranial Regulation\n", "RESEARCH EVIDENCE\nKetogenic Diets and Neuroprotection Properties\nPrevious research has shown that a ketogenic diet\u2014which \nconsists of significant carbohydrate restriction and high \nfat intake (80% to 90% of calories)\u2014can reduce seizures \nin\u00a0children with medication-resistant or hard-to-control \ndisorders. A strict ketogenic diet appears to promote cer\u00ad\ntain chemical neuroprotective properties. For example, \nketone bodies such as \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate may pro\u00ad\ntect nerves against cellular injury by increasing anti-\u00ad\ninflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as increasing \nenergy reserves for neurons affected by injury (Martin, \n\u00adJackson, Levy, & Cooper, 2016). Activation of adenosine \ntriphosphate (ATP)\u2013sensitive potassium channels and \n\u00adinhibition of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission \nare other mechanisms that have been suggested as being \nprotective (Danial, Hartman, Stastrom, & Thio, 2013).\nNursing Care\nBesides promoting safety in all aspects of the child\u2019s \nhome, recreational, and academic life, the second most \nimportant aspect of nursing care of a child with a seizure \ndisorder is to support the child and family with medical \nadherence, demonstrated by adequate and safe ranges of \nserum anticonvulsant therapy. Education is paramount so \nthat families will understand the importance of ensuring \nconsistent anticonvulsant medication administration, at \nthe same time each day, so dips in serum concentrations \nof the medications do not occur. Many children with \ncomplicated seizure disorders have a low seizure threshold \nand need their medications taken on time and with great \nconsistency. Families need to be taught to document any \nseizure activity, including precipitating factors, seizure \nactivity witnessed, and length of each seizure.\nWhen interacting with families whose child is suspected \nof having a seizure, the pediatric nurse should ask the fol\u00ad\nlowing questions:\n\u2022\t In which setting did the seizure activity occur? At \nwhich time of day?\n\u2022\t Which activity was the child participating in just \nbefore the seizure began?\n\u2022\t What were the precipitating factors occurring just \nprior to the seizure?\n\u2022\t Did the child describe a sensory experience (aura) \nprior to the seizure?\n\u2022\t What did the seizure behavior look like? Was it gen\u00ad\neral or focal? What were the limb movements like?\n\u2022\t What was the duration of the seizure activity?\n\u2022\t What the child\u2019s postseizure behavior? Was there a \npostictal state (i.e., somnolence, confusion, sleepi\u00ad\nness, fatigue)?\n\u2022\t What is the child\u2019s medical history, current state, \nand overall state of health?\nOther Neurologic Disorders\nMuscular Dystrophy\nMuscular dystrophy comprises a group of inherited progres\u00ad\nsively degenerative diseases that cause muscle weakness, \natrophy, and degeneration. When the disease has a child\u00ad\nhood onset, it tends to be Duchenne muscular dystrophy, \nwhich mostly affects males.\nThe pathology of muscular dystrophy is linked to a \ngenetically induced reduction or absence of dystrophin, a \nmuscle protein. As muscle fibers degenerate, the body fills \nthe vacated space with connective tissue layers and adipose \ntissue. Key signs of muscular dystrophy are waddling gait, \nweakened pelvic floor, wide stance when standing, and \nGower\u2019s sign (difficulty with rising from a sitting or lying \nposition). Progression of the disease is rapid, with most \naffected children no longer being able to ambulate by \n12\u00a0years of age. Diagnosis is confirmed by muscle biopsy, \nelectromyography, and increased serum creatine kinase \nlevels due to muscle breakdown.\nThere is no known cure for muscular dystrophy, so treat\u00ad\nment is supportive. Nursing care focuses on providing a \nsafe environment, promoting an emotional support system \nfor the child and family, encouraging good nutrition, and \nsupporting the respiratory system.\nCerebral Palsy\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a nonprogressive, neuromuscular \ndisorder that is most commonly associated with pathology \ninduced by a hypoxic or anoxic birth incident affecting the \nsegment of the brain that controls motor function. Many \nmaternal influences have been known to contribute to CP, \nincluding infections (especially rubella), drug ingestions, \nperiods of anoxia, isoimmunization, toxemia, and diabe\u00ad\ntes. Perinatal influences include prolapsed cord, placenta \nabruptio, and delay in delivery of the newborn\u2019s head. The \nthree types of CP are spastic (affecting the cortex), ataxic \n(cerebellum), and athetoid (basal ganglia).\nMany children with CP have poor control of motor \nmovements, and some experience paralysis. In some cases, \ncognitive function and intelligence may not be affected at \nall, but different forms of cognitive and other neurologic \nimpairments (e.g., speech, vision) occur to varying degrees \n(Odding, Roebroeck, & Stam, 2006). Typical clinical symp\u00ad\ntoms include abnormal motor performance, delayed gross \nmotor development, thin extremities, abnormal gait (e.g., \nscissors gait), hypertonia, flexion, contractures, sensory \ndefects, and feeding difficulty.\n\t\nOther Neurologic Disorders\t\n309\n", "Figure 21-12\u2002 A child with spina bifida.\n\u00a9 Diomedia/BSIP\nTreatments for CP are not curative. Medications used \nfor such patients include baclofen to relieve spasticity and \nmuscle relaxants. Nursing care involves family support and \neducation to prevent injury, reduce contraction of muscles \nthrough range of motion (ROM) exercises, and assessments \nfor nutrition risks and skin breakdown.\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a progressive ascending \npolyneuritis leading to paralysis. Without resolution, this \nprogressive condition can be fatal if severe respiratory \ndistress leads to complete respiratory failure. The pathology \nstems from the body\u2019s autoimmune attack on the myelin \n(phospholipid protein) sheath of peripheral nerve cells. In \nchildren, the etiology of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is often \nassociated with a resolving gastrointestinal viral infection \nor some other immune system stimulus.\nThere is no treatment for this syndrome. Medical sup\u00ad\nport to maintain adequate ventilation may be required \nwhile the condition takes its course. Most children recover \nfrom Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome; few have lasting neurologic \nsequelae.\nNeural Tube Defects\nNeural tube defects, which include spina bifida, are structural \ndefects of the central nervous system due to inadequate \nclosure of the neural tube during fetal development. This \nstate may produce any of several defects, all with variable \nseverity. Research has shown that inadequate maternal \nconsumption of folic acid at conception and in the first \ntrimester of pregnancy increases the risk of neural tube \ndefects in the fetus.\nSpina bifida (Figure 21-12) is divided into two main \nclassifications:\n\u2022\t Meningocele, where the bony spinal column is \nopen, allowing for a sac to protrude that contains \nCSF and the meninges\n\u2022\t Myelomeningocele, where the protrusion includes \nthe CSF, the meninges, and a segment of the child\u2019s \nspinal cord\nMedical treatment for spina bifida consists of surgical \nrepair. Nursing care includes immediate care of the sac after \ndelivery, preoperative and postoperative care of the incision, \nand education for the family on the complications associated \nwith the varying severity of the defect. Children may have \nmotor limitations and weakness, decreased bladder function \nand increased risks for urinary tract infection, inadequacy \nof bowel control, increased risk for hydrocephalus, increased \nICP, meningitis, and paralysis. Complications depend on \nthe severity of the spinal cord involvement. Children with \nspina bifida are also at increased risk for latex allergies.\nHypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy\nHypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is often the patho\u00ad\nlogical consequence of a near-drowning experience, but \nmay be present in newborns who are asphyxiated at birth \n(Fatemi, Wilson, & Johnston, 2009) and can sometimes be \nseen in children who have suffered intentional injuries, such \nas choking or abusive head trauma (AAP, 2015). In neonates, \nthe injury can lead to cerebral palsy and multiple disabilities.\nThe child who has suffered a nonfatal drowning may have \nirreversible multisystem injuries, including multi-organ \nhypoxia from prolonged hypoxemia. The lungs, brain, and \nkidneys are most likely to be affected with HIE. Within the \nbrain, the tissues most susceptible to injury are the hip\u00ad\npocampus, insular cortex, and basal ganglia. Long-term \nconsequences related to submersion accidents depend on \nthe duration of submersion and the success of aggressive \nresuscitation efforts in the field (Suominen & Vahatalo, 2012).\nConcussions\nConcussions in childhood are mainly associated with sports \ninjuries or head injuries during recreational activities. As \nmany as 53% of child athletes have reported experienc\u00ad\ning a concussion by the time they enter high school. The \nmajority of concussions occur in children age 10 to 19. \nConsidered a mild TBI, the impact of a direct hit to the \nhead causes the child\u2019s brain to develop neuropathy such \nas micro-bleeds and axonal injury.\n310\t\nChapter 21\u2003 Intracranial Regulation\n", "Two types of cerebral bleeds are distinguished:\n\u2022\t Subdural hematoma: Caused by an injury or ac\u00ad\ncident, it is considered a slower venous bleed lead\u00ad\ning to a clot below the dura mater but outside of \nbrain tissue. Veins tear and bleed often from skull \nfractures.\n\u2022\t Epidural hematoma: Caused by an injury to the \nhead, it is considered a rapid arterial bleed where a \nclot forms above the dura mater. This cerebral arte\u00ad\nrial bleed is also associated with skull fractures.\nChildhood Migraines\nMigraine headaches are not uncommon in children, and the \naverage age of symptom onset is 7. There is a link between \nchildhood migraines and hereditary factors. Symptoms of \nchildhood migraines include unilateral or bilateral pain \noften described as pounding or throbbing, nausea, vertigo, \nvomiting, body paresthesias, and photosensitivity. Migraines \ncan be exacerbated by menses in adolescent females.\nTreatment for migraines should be holistic and in\u00ad\nclude rest, stress management, diet, removal of known \nenvironmental triggers (e.g., lights, weather changes, \naltitude changes, odors, screen time) and stress-related \ntriggers, adequate sleep, and exercise. Some children are \nvery sensitive to nitrates in food, so their consumption \nshould be avoided.\nMedical management requires one or more of the fol\u00ad\nlowing pharmacologic categories: abortive medications that \nwork on blood vessel receptors, preventive medications \nto influence the onset of a migraine episode, and rescue \nanalgesic medications for immediate pain relief (Johns \nHopkins Medicine, 2015). Specific medications for child\u00ad\nhood migraines include the following agents:\n\u2022\t Beta blockers\n\u2022\t Antiseizure medications\n\u2022\t Tricyclic antidepressants\n\u2022\t Naproxen\n\u2022\t Acetaminophen\n\u2022\t Ibuprofen\n\u2022\t Triptans\nSingle concussions are considered to produce a transient \nbrain injury; subsequent concussions can increase the \nrisk for greater neurodegenerative impairment, including \nmemory loss, traumatic encephalopathy, post-traumatic \nstress disorder, and cognitive defects.

The first category includes difficulty concentrating, \nthinking clearly, or remembering new information, and can \nbe expressed as \u201cfeeling slow.\u201d Physical symptoms include \ndizziness, poor balance, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, \nphotophobia, and poor coordination. Emotional or mood \nsymptoms include anxiety, irritability, and depression. Sleep \ndisturbances may range from insomnia to hypersomnia, \nor involve difficulty falling asleep. Loss of consciousness is \nnot needed to make a diagnosis of a concussion. Symptoms \ncan start immediately following impact, or they can be \nprogressive or be delayed (Semple et\u00a0al., 2015).\nSevere Lead Poisoning\nDespite national efforts to reduce exposure, children con\u00ad\ntinue to be exposed to significant levels of lead in more than \n4 million homes in the United States. Healthy People 2020 \nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \nundertaken initiatives designed to reduce childhood lead \nblood levels that are more than 10 mcg/dL. The CDC uses a \nblood serum level of 5 mcg/dL to identify children who have \nbeen exposed to lead and need case management. Medical \nmanagement with chelation therapy is needed when levels \nreach 45 mcg/dL; prior to that point, it is more effective \nto remove lead sources from the child\u2019s environment than \nto rely on chelation therapy (Lowry, 2010). Serum blood \nlevels of lead that reach 90 mcg/dL have been associated \nwith neurologic consequences, including cerebral edema \n(CDC, 2016b).\nCerebral Bleeds\nCerebral vascular accidents in childhood are rare, but are \nassociated primarily with prematurity, trauma, anatomic \nmalformations such as Chiari malformation or arteriove\u00ad\nnous malformation, or aneurysm. Children who experience \ncerebral bleeds require rapid identification and treatment. \nSymptoms include severe sudden headaches; vomiting; \ndizziness; trouble with movement, speech, or vision; and \nseizures.\nPHARMACOLOGY \nPreventive Therapies Used in Childhood \nMigraine Headaches\n\u2022\t Antidepressant: amitriptyline\n\u2022\t Antihistamines: cyproheptadine\n\u2022\t Antiepileptics: levetiracetam, divalproex sodium, or \ntopiramate\n\u2022\t Calcium-channel blockers: flunarizine\n\t\nOther Neurologic Disorders\t\n311\n", "\u25c6\u25c6With healthy and consistent development, the newborn \nbegins life with neurologic stability and predictable \ngrowth and maturity.\n\u25c6\u25c6Acquired and congenital disorders can lead to the \ndysregulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Currently in great physical shape, he has been gearing \nup throughout the summer for a vigorous physical team \nsport by working out and running. Playing as the linebacker, \nMartin experienced a moderate concussion with a brief loss \nof consciousness during a preseason practice game with \nhis own team members. The game was put on hold while \n911 was called. Paramedics responded by driving onto the \nplaying field and picking Martin up for rapid transport to \nthe nearest emergency department (ED).

A young child has an \nimmature renal system, and this immaturity affects the \nkidneys\u2019 function and efficiency. Developmental differences \nin children influence not only fluid and electrolyte balance, \nbut also the process of waste elimination. In the infant, the \nkidneys are unable to concentrate waste products into the \nform of urine for excretion. Consequently, infants\u2019 urine \nhas a lower specific gravity (typically 1.010 or less) than \nthe urine of older children or adults. Infants and young \nchildren need a higher rate of metabolism to support their \nrapid growth and energy production. On average, this rate \nis 2 to 3 times higher than the metabolic rate in adults, \nwhich also means that infants and young children require \ngreater amounts of body water. Furthermore, insensible \nwater loss is greater for infants and young children due to \ntheir overall increased heart rates, respiration rates, gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal peristaltic rates, and fever heights (Box 22-1).\nNewborns and young infants are highly susceptible \nto defects that occur during fetal development. Neonates \nwho present in the first days of life with a single umbili\u00ad\ncal artery, congenital malformation, abdominal mass, or \nchromosomal abnormality may be more susceptible to \nthe development of a pediatric genitourinary disorder \nor disease. Also, a specific set of diagnoses in the mother \nIntroduction\nGenitourinary elimination involves multiple systems, but \nmost prominently the renal system. The production of \nthe body\u2019s wastes and the elimination of urine involves \nthe processes of nutrient and fluid consumption, absorp\u00ad\ntion, distribution, and excretion of the end products of \nmetabolism. The renal system has ultimate responsibility \nfor body fluid regulation and balance. The field of urology \nencompasses the study and functions of the kidney, renal, \npelvis, ureters, bladder, urethra, and reproductive organs \n(Figure 22-1).\nPediatric Renal Function\nThe kidneys perform six functions:\n\u2022\t Elimination of liquid waste products from the blood \nwithin a process of detoxification in the form of urine.\n\u2022\t Production of the hormone erythropoietin, which stim\u00ad\nulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells.\n\u2022\t Production of the chemical renin, which stimu\u00ad\nlates the production of first angiotensin I, then \nBOX 22-1\u2002 Body Water\nThe percentage of total body weight that is accounted for \nby water is far different in premature infants, newborns, and \nyoung infants than during later phases of life:\n\u2022\t Premature infants have approximately 90% of their \ntotal weight as body water.\n\u2022\t Infants have approximately 70% to 80% of their total \nweight as body water.\n\u2022\t Adolescents have 55% to 65% of their total weight as \nbody water.\nFigure 22-1\u2002 The genitourinary system.\nKidney\nUreter\nUrinary\nbladder\nUrethra\nReproductive\norgans\n316\t\nChapter 22\u2003 Genitourinary Elimination\n", "during pregnancy should put the pediatric healthcare team \non alert to look for the development of renal disease or \ndisorder in a newborn. These maternal conditions include \nthe following diagnoses:\n\u2022\t Oligohydramnios\n\u2022\t Polyhydramnios\n\u2022\t New-onset or preexisting diabetes\n\u2022\t Alcohol or cocaine ingestion\n\u2022\t Hypertension\nDuring the newborn period and early infancy, children \ndemonstrate less efficacy in the regulation of fluids, waste \nproducts, concentration of urine, and overall balance of the \nelectrolytes. Metabolism is much higher during early life \ncompared to the rest of the life span, and the total kilocalories \nrequired for growth are the highest of any time in life. Never\u00ad\ntheless, the newborn\u2019s renal system remains immature and is \nnot able to function with the same efficiency as an older child\u2019s \nrenal system. As a result, any disorders in the renal system \nleave the newborn and infant vulnerable to dehydration, poor \npH regulation, fluid retention, hypertension, and uremia \n(buildup of urea and other waste products in the body).\nAn infant has less body water reserves within the intracel\u00ad\nlular space for conservation during disorders or conditions \nthat lead to fluid loss. With an overall body water turnover \nrate of 50%, infants are at greater risk for dehydration and \nfluid imbalances. Owing to their relatively large body surface \narea, they are also at greater risk for evaporation of fluids \nwith skin exposure, fevers, and heat loss.\nOne of the most important skills unique to the care of \npediatric patients is performing accurate intake and output \n(I&O) measurements. Children produce approximately \n1 to 2 quarts of urine each day, with the kidneys filtering \n120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce this output. Because \nof young children\u2019s renal maturity challenges and their \nsusceptibility to fluid imbalances, the pediatric nurse must \nkeep meticulous records of all output in relation to the \nchild\u2019s intake. As children grow and mature, and become \nbetter able to concentrate their waste products, the number \nof times they urinate begins to decline.\nDaily body weights and weighing of all diapers is the \nmost effective means to determine a child\u2019s fluid status. \nDiapers are first weighed when dry, and this value is then \nsubtracted from the weight of the soiled diaper. One gram \nof urine weight is considered equivalent to 1 mL of urine \nvolume. Average urine production for hydrated children \nacross the developmental period is as follows:\n\u2022\t Newborn: 10 mL/hr\n\u2022\t Infant: 5\u201210 mL/hr\n\u2022\t Toddler and preschooler:15\u201220 mL/hr\n\u2022\t School-age child: 10\u201225 mL/hr\n\u2022\t Adolescent: more than 30 mL/hr\nGenitourinary Disorders in Children\nDisorders of the genitourinary elimination system are \ncommon during childhood, with approximately 1.2 million \nchildren presenting with a urinary tract infection each year. \nAccording to the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology \n(2015), 300,000 children develop conditions in which blood \nand protein are present in urine. This clinical presentation \nis consistent with conditions such as glomerulonephritis, \nnephrotic syndrome, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.\nAssessment of the genitourinary system should be \nconducted both during visits where the child is ill or \nduring well-child visits. Fluid status, skin turgor, weight \nfor height and age, vital signs, peripheral pulses, and gen\u00ad\neral appearance should all be assessed. Three common \nclinical \u00adpresentations\u2014febrile illness, diarrhea, and vom\u00ad\niting\u2014contribute to the need for meticulous assessments \nand screening of fluid status. Because the genitourinary \nsystem is a part of the body\u2019s acid\u2012base balance, children \nwith moderate to high fluid losses should be assessed for \nacid\u2012base imbalances, particularly metabolic acidosis \n(increased acidity of the blood) and metabolic alkalosis \n(abnormally low hydrogen ion concentration in the blood). \nMetabolic acidosis is associated with excessive vomiting, \nwhereas metabolic alkalosis is associated with excessive \nand prolonged diarrhea. During periods of acidosis, the \nchild will compensate by blowing off excess carbon dioxide \n(CO2) via the respiratory system or, alternatively, the renal \nsystem will retain bicarbonate (HCO3) to correct metabolic \nacidosis or release HCO3 to correct metabolic alkalosis.\nBEST PRACTICES\nCommon Diagnostic Exams Performed in \nPediatric Patients to Identify Disorders of Urinary \nElimination\n\u2022\t Urinalysis\n\u2022\t Urine culture and sensitivity (Figure 22-2)\n\u2022\t Specific gravity\n\u2022\t Creatinine clearance\n\u2022\t Voiding cystourethrogram\n\u2022\t Renal angiogram\n\u2022\t Glomerular filtration rate\n\u2022\t Blood urea nitrogen\n\u2022\t Blood creatinine\n\u2022\t Intravenous pyelogram\nNursing Care for Children with Genitourinary \nDisorders\nChildren who will need nursing care for their genitourinary \ndisorder may present with a variety of concerns. Infection, \ninflammation, obstruction, and complications associated \n\t\nGenitourinary Disorders in Children\t\n317\n", "cause infection. It is imperative that girls learn to wipe from \nfront to back after defecating to avoid this risk. Infant boys \nwho are not circumcised have a slightly increased risk for \nthe development of a UTI (MedlinePlus, 2014).\nA UTI is formally defined as more than 5 \u00d7 104 colonies \nof bacteria per milliliters of urine. Common microbial \nculprits in pediatric UTIs are gram-negative aerobic \nbacteria, with gram-positive bacteria being encountered \nless often. Pediatric nurses should be aware that there is \na developmental pattern to the microbes that cause UTIs \nin children (Imam, 2013; Qureshi, 2005):\n\u2022\t Infants are most susceptible to Escherichia coli \n\u00adinfections due to sitting in diapers soiled with stool.\n\u2022\t Toddlers are most susceptible to E. coli and Klebsi\u00ad\nella infections.\n\u2022\t Preschoolers are most susceptible to E. coli, Klebsi\u00ad\nella, and Pseudomonas infections.\n\u2022\t School-age children are most susceptible to \nKlebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Proteus mirabilis \ninfections.\n\u2022\t Adolescents are most susceptible to E. coli, Klebsiella, \nPseudomonas, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and \ngroups B and D streptococcal infections.\nwith congenital anomalies in the genitourinary or repro\u00ad\nductive system are commonly seen. Using the nursing \nprocess, the pediatric nurse formulates an appropriate \nfocused assessment, decides on priority nursing diagnoses, \nand then formulates goals and interventions that will best \nsuit the child\u2019s physiological, physical, developmental, \nand emotional needs. Young children, in particular, need \ncomprehensive nursing care focused on developmental \ninfluences. For instance, infants and young children who \nare acutely ill typically do not take in oral fluids at the rate \nand quantity required for balance and healing. Children \nwho present with continued fever, acute gastrointestinal \ninfections with diarrhea and vomiting, and complications \nassociated with common urinary tract infections (UTIs) \nwill have extra fluid losses and, in turn, higher fluid needs. \nThe daily calculation of a child\u2019s fluid maintenance require\u00ad\nments is essential to ensure these needs are being met.\nInfectious Processes\nChildren of any age or sex may present with a genito\u00ad\nurinary system infection. Their relatively short urethras \n(Figure 22-3), urinary reflux, anatomic anomalies, and \nsitting in a soiled diaper with stool make children more \nsusceptible to genitourinary infectious processes. Rapid \ndiagnosis and prompt treatment of such infectious processes \ncan help prevent strictures, scarring, or issues with infertility \nin adolescence or adulthood. Kidney infections are called \npyelonephritis, urethra infections are called urethritis, and \nbladder infections are called cystitis.\nUrinary Tract Infections\nCompared to adults, young children have shorter urethras \nthat leave them more susceptible to urinary tract infections. \nGirls have very short urethras (3 to 5 cm in length), which \nallows bacteria to readily migrate up to the bladder and \nPHARMACOLOGY\nI\nn female pediatric clients, the use of antibiotics profoundly \ndisrupts the homeostatic presence of normal microflora in the \nvaginal area, which can lead to persistent E. coli colonization. \nGenital flora, including lactobacilli and staphylococci, provide a \nnatural resistance to urinary pathogens until antibiotic therapy \ndisrupts their presence (Finer & Landau, 2004).\nFigure 22-3\u2002 Comparison of urethra size between male and female \ninfants. \nUrinary system\nKidney\nUreter\nBladder\nUrethra\nTesticle\nUrethra\nBladder\nUreter\nKidney\nMale\nFemale\nFigure 22-2\u2002 A urine culture and sensitivity laboratory study.\n\u00a9 Jarun Ontakrai/Shutterstock\n318\t\nChapter 22\u2003 Genitourinary Elimination\n", "Nursing Care for a Child with UTI\nNursing care of a child with a suspected or confirmed \nUTI includes patient teaching, family education, symp\u00ad\ntom management, and medical treatment initiation.

Dietary strategies for UTI \nprevention include encouraging children to maintain an \nadequate fluid intake (Lotan et\u00a0al., 2013) and consume \nplain yogurt containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nR\necurrent UTIs in children are often associated with voiding \ndysfunctions, incomplete bladder emptying, incontinence \nwith inadequate cleansing, chronic constipation affecting the \nfunction of the detrusor muscle, and high-grade vesicoureteral \nreflux. As many as 50% of infants and 30% of children who \npresent with UTIs have genitourinary structural anomalies \n(Weinberg, 2015). Children who present with abnormal or \ninfrequently found bacteria, severe flank pain, high fever, \nnausea and vomiting, and chills require an immediate workup \nfor possible retrograde infection (bacteria that have moved \nfrom the bladder into the kidneys). Presence of heme, white \nblood cells (WBCs), casts, leukocyte esterase, and foul smell \nare common in urine associated with UTI.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nR\nates of UTI in boys who are uncircumcised have been found \nto show only a 2.2% increase throughout childhood, but are \n8-fold higher during the male infant\u2019s first year of life (Hinfey \n& Steele, 2015). These data do not support the supposition \nthat circumcision in male children is a medical necessity. \nProper hygiene after stooling is the most important step in \npreventing the development of UTIs.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nF\nrequently prescribed antimicrobials for urinary tract infections \nin pediatric patients include the following agents (Herbert \n& Roth, 2015; Iman, 2013):\n\u2022\t Ampicillin (Omnipen)\n\u2022\t Amoxicillin (Amoxil)\n\u2022\t Cephalexin (Keflex)\n\u2022\t Gentamicin (Garamycin)\n\u2022\t Co-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra)\n\u2022\t Nitrofurantoin\n\u2022\t Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)\nOral or IV fluids should be administered during treatment. \nFluids in amounts up to 100 mL/kg/day may be ordered.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nR\nesearch demonstrates that consuming cranberry juice \ncapsules after having genitourinary or reproductive surgery \nin which a urinary catheter is placed can reduce the risk of \ndeveloping a UTI. (Foxman, Cronenwett, Spino, Berger, & \nMorgan, 2015).\nPyelonephritis\nPyelonephritis is often observed in infants and young chil\u00ad\ndren who present with an acute febrile UTI where bacteria \nhave ascended. Considered an upper genitourinary tract \ninfection, pyelonephritis is an infection of the structures \nof the kidneys. Approximately one out of every 30 UTIs \n(lower genitourinary tract) will develop into pyelonephri\u00ad\ntis (Urology Care Foundation, 2015). Common bacterial \nculprits include Escherichia coli (90% of cases), Klebsiella, \nEnterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus and Staphylococcus \ncultures, as there is some indication that probiotics in \ncombination with antibiotic therapy may offer protection \nagainst UTI recurrence (Tewari & Narchi, 2015).\n\t\nInfectious Processes\t\n319\n", "Sexually transmitted infections are, by nature, infections \nthat are passed during either sexual intercourse or during \nsome form of genital contact. Thus, while testing for STIs, \nthe team frequently tests females for pregnancy.\nChildren at highest risk for STIs are those between the \nages of 15 and 19 (Child Trends Databank, 2015), those \nwith a recent history of sexual intercourse or intimate \ngenital contact without condom use, and those who are \nintravenous drug users. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2011), STIs are \na critical health challenge, with at least 19 million new \ncases per year, costing more than $17 billion to treat. The \nthree top treatable STIs found in high-risk children are \nsyphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea (CDC, 2011; Child \nTrends Databank, 2015) (Table 22-1). Untreated STIs and \ndelayed treatment of STIs are associated with infertility.\nChildren, particularly young teenagers, must be offered \nhealth screening for STIs if infection is suspected. Some \npediatric healthcare settings offer STI testing whether or \nnot children state they are or have been sexually active. \nDetermining whether a child is sexually active is not as \nimportant as offering screening. Young teens, especially, \n(both gram-positive bacteria and both rare etiologies) \n(Hinfey & Steele, 2015).\nIf a child with a UTI has a fever, the child\u2019s condition \nshould prompt suspicion of pyelonephritis and be treated \npromptly with appropriate antibiotics. Adolescents who \npresent with symptoms of UTI accompanied with chills, \nfever, and flank pain should be assessed for pyelonephritis. \nYoung children may also demonstrate nausea, vomit\u00ad\ning, and diarrhea when this type of infection is present. \nComplications of this condition may include dehydration, \nhypertension, renal scarring, and renal failure. Treatment \nconsists of oral fluids and oral antibiotics for children with \nmild infection, and IV fluids and IV antibiotics for children \nwho are experiencing associated gastrointestinal distress \nor gastrointestinal fluid losses and/or who appear quite ill \nfrom the infection.\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) during childhood \noccur mostly in the adolescent developmental period.

Additionally, adolescents may not perceive \nthemselves to be at risk (Schneider, FitzGerald, Bycz\u00ad\nkowski, & Reed, 2016). Nurses who identify children at \nrisk or suspect children to be at risk should offer testing \nimmediately, especially in cases of actual or suspected \nchild sexual abuse or rape.\nIf symptomatic, children and teens with STIs may pres\u00ad\nent with genital discharge with or without odor, genital \npain, dysuria, and lesions. Nevertheless, the majority \nof males and females with chlamydia are asymptomatic \n(Committee on Adolescence & Society for Adolescent \nHealth and Medicine, 2014). Keeping privacy paramount, \nthe pediatric nurse will assist with physical assessment \nand specimen collection.\nMany states now allow young teenagers to seek \nmedical care for STI diagnosis, STI treatment, and birth \ncontrol without parental or guardian consent. Even so, \nadolescents may have questions about confidentiality, \nwhich the nurse should be prepared to answer.\nTreatment for STIs includes oral antibiotics, oral antivirals \n(for herpes), and follow-up for assessment of adherence \nto the medications.\nAcute Glomerulonephritis\nGlomerulonephritis is a kidney condition that develops \nfollowing an infectious process\u2014typically 1 week to \n10\u00a0days after a streptococcal infection. The kidney\u2019s small \ncollection tubules, which are attached to blood vessels \nand which are where urine is filtered from the blood, are \ncalled the glomeruli and nephrons (Figure 22-7). When \na child experiences a significant streptococcal infection, \nthe antigen\u2012antibody complexes that result from the body\u2019s \nimmune response, which seeks to destroy and remove the \nstreptococcal bacteria\u2019s cellular wastes, become deposited \nin the glomeruli and clog the final filtration system. The \nclogged nephrons become inflamed, impairing the kid\u00ad\nney\u2019s ability to filter liquid waste. Aside from streptococ\u00ad\ncal infections, inflammatory diseases of the arteries and \ngenetic dispositions are the most common causes of acute \nglomerulonephritis (AGN).\nNursing Care for a Child with Acute Glomerulonephritis\nThe child with AGN will present with dark brown urine \nwhose appearance mimics that of strongly brewed tea. The \nchild\u2019s total urine output will decline as the child progresses \n\t\nInfectious Processes\t\n321\n", "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare and potentially \nlethal form of kidney failure in children who develop an \ninfection caused by either Escherichia coli 0157.H7 or \nEscherichia coli 0111. The initial infections caused by these \nagents may be acquired from eating contaminated foods \nor raw meat. Outbreaks of HUS are more common in the \nsummer and are closely associated with the consumption of \ninadequately cooked meats, intake of unpasteurized dairy \nproducts or juices, and contaminated swimming pools, \nwater parks, daycare facilities, and fast-food restaurants. \nHUS can also be associated with certain medications.\nto renal failure. In many cases, the child will have a recent \nhistory of a streptococcal infection, including sore throat, \ntooth abscesses, UTIs, skin infections, or other strep-related \nsymptoms. Often, the child with AGN feels fatigued and \nexperiences dyspnea, headache, joint pain, rash, elevated \nblood pressure, and edema. The edema associated with \nAGN appears in the early morning as puffy eyes and then \nprogresses to the rest of the body. The clinical presentation \nis aligned with the changes happening in the body, which \nlead toward acute renal failure.\nLaboratory findings will include positive strep throat \ncultures, blood cultures, and/or urine cultures. The medi\u00ad\ncal team will order chest X-rays to identify the cause of \npulmonary congestion, as well as a renal ultrasound and \nrenal biopsy. The following laboratory analyses can also be \nused to demonstrate the presence of the AGN pathology:\n\u2022\t Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\n\u2022\t Depressed complement C3 and C4 levels\n\u2022\t Mild to moderate elevated blood urea nitrogen \n(BUN) and creatinine\n\u2022\t Elevated anti-DNase B titer\n\u2022\t Elevated antistreptolysin-O titer\nMedical treatment for AGN focuses on the immediate \ntreatment of any remaining streptococcal infections, res\u00ad\ntoration of fluid balance, reduction of urea buildup, and \nrestoration of kidney function. Potential interventions \ninclude antibiotics, diuretics, antihypertensives, and phos\u00ad\nphate binders to reduce buildup of phosphates in the blood.\nNursing care focuses on the acuity of the situation at \nhand. A child with AGN can present as very sick and, there\u00ad\nfore, requires astute assessments and care. Daily weights \non the same scale to accurately determine the response of \nfluid and waste-product removal and edema reduction are \nimperative. Symptom management becomes important, \nas the child will suffer headaches, body aches, malaise, \narthralgia, gastrointestinal distress, and hypertension.\nFigure 22-7\u2002 Kidney glomeruli and nephrons.\nCollecting tubule\nDistal convoluted\ntubule\nProximal\nconvoluted\ntubule\nHenle\u2019s loop\nRenal papilla\nGlomerulus\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nA\nstute nursing care of a child with AGN requires rapid iden\u00ad\ntification of clinical symptoms based on a health history \nof the preceding infection. Rapid reporting of the findings will \nallow the pediatric healthcare team to respond to the buildup \nof waste products and glomeruli damage. For a child with acute \npharyngitis, the typical latency period may be as long as 10 to \n21 days after the initial infection, with symptoms of AGN then \nbecoming manifest. For a skin infection caused by Streptococ\u00ad\ncus, the latency period can be even longer, averaging 5 to \n6 weeks. Being able to connect the dots\u2014that is, linking early \nAGN symptoms to a history of strep infections\u2014can improve \nclinical outcomes for the child (Ayoob & Schwaderer, 2016).\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nU\nsing the principles of anticipatory guidance, families need \nto be taught and then reminded about hygienic food \npreparation to help prevent HUS. These measures include \nwashing all raw vegetables and fruits, cooking meat to a \ntemperature of at least 160\u00b0F, preventing spread of disease-\ncausing microbes on kitchen surfaces and cutting boards, \nand maintaining good hand hygiene when preparing foods.\nThe presence of bacteria in the blood damages red blood \ncells and causes massive lysis of the cells. This pathology of \nHUS leads to acute nephropathy, microangiopathic hemolytic \nanemia, and thrombocytopenia. If a child has seizures associ\u00ad\nated with HUS, his or her prognosis is considered guarded.\nHUS is most commonly seen in young children between \n4 months and 4 years of age. Common early presentations \ninclude complaints of severe abdominal pain, followed by \nvomiting and bloody, watery diarrhea. Upon assessment, \nthe team will find dehydration and small bruises on the \nlining of the mouth. The kidneys become overwhelmed as \nthe number of damaged and lysed red blood cells (RBCs) \nincreases, and their passageways become clogged to the \n322\t\nChapter 22\u2003 Genitourinary Elimination\n", "Nephrotic Syndrome\nNephrotic syndrome, also called minimal change \nnephrotic syndrome, is a complex set of symptoms, \nconsidered idiopathic in nature, that occurs more often \nin male children than female children. Associated with \nthe development of large pores on the final filtration \nmembrane of the child\u2019s kidney, it is characterized \nby a significant loss of serum protein into the urine \n(Table\u00a022-3). There are four cardinal symptoms of \nnephrotic syndrome:\n\u2022\t Severe proteinuria\n\u2022\t Severe hypoproteinemia\n\u2022\t Hyperlipidemia\n\u2022\t Generalized edema, especially noted in the \n\u00adabdomen (ascites)\npoint that the child experiences renal failure with subsequent \nuremia and fluid retention. The child with HUS will need \nrapid transport to a higher level of care (intensive care unit \n[ICU]) for fluid management, edema reduction, dialysis, \nand management of any bleeding, anemia, and electrolyte \ndisturbances that may be present.\nOther Pediatric Disorders of the \nGenitourinary System\nMany childhood genitourinary disorders can be classified \ninto one of four general categories: obstructive disorders, \ndisorders related to nerve or structural damage, and dis\u00ad\norders that pertain to specific sexes. Table 22-2 introduces \nseveral of these pediatric genitourinary disorders.\nTABLE 22-2\u2003\nOther Pediatric Genitourinary Disorders\nGenitourinary Obstructive Disorders\n\u203a\u203a\nKidney stone: A solid material that evolves when urine components become highly concentrated and form a small stone. \nThe stone can become lodged in the ureter. This condition is associated with severe pain and blood in the urine.\n\u203a\u203a\nPolycystic kidney disease: A hereditary condition in which clusters of fluid-filled cysts are found anywhere throughout the \nkidney structure, and possibly other organs such as the liver. These cysts can grow large and lead to kidney function failure.\n\u203a\u203a\nHydronephrosis: An obstruction of urinary outflow of the kidney by any means, which causes urine to build up, typically \nwithin the renal pelvis. Several types of obstruction may block the bladder outlet, or the presence of kidney stones may lead \nto hydronephrosis.\nGenitourinary Disorders Associated with Nerve Damage or Structural Damage\n\u203a\u203a\nNeurogenic bladder: Nerve damage resulting in abnormal retention of urine or leaking of urine from the bladder, typically \ncaused by a spinal cord injury.\n\u203a\u203a\nUreterocele: A congenital condition marked by abnormality in the ureter. Often having a cyst-like nature, the affected area \nis usually located near the distal end of the ureter where it opens into the urinary bladder. The segment of tissue balloons \noutward, forming a sac-like pouch.\n\u203a\u203a\nVesicoureteral reflux: Reflux of urine up into the ureters before or after urination.\nMale Genitourinary Disorders \n\u203a\u203a\nHypospadias: An abnormally positioned opening of the urinary meatus, which may be located in various areas of the penis \nor base of the penis\u2014most commonly on the underside of the penis.\n\u203a\u203a\nEpispadias: Abnormal positioning of the urinary meatus on the upper side (dorsum) of the penis (Figure 22-8).\n\u203a\u203a\nUndescended testicle (cryptorchidism): Testicles typically descend by 9 months of age; cryptorchidism is marked by one or \nboth of the testes remaining in the abdomen. The scrotal sac keeps the testicles 2\u20133\u00b0F cooler than the body temperature. The \nlonger the testicles remain in the warmer environment of the abdomen, the greater change of dysfunction and infertility.\n\u203a\u203a\nPriapism: The inability of an erect penis to return to the flaccid state. Surgery, clot evacuation, or medications such as \npseudoephedrine, amphetamine, or phenylephrine may be required to reduce the erection and prevent hypoxia and tissue \ndamage. High-flow priapism (less common) requires interventions and is associated with nerve dysfunction in conditions \nsuch as spinal cord injury. Low-flow priapism (80\u201390% of pediatric cases) is caused by blood not returning to the body. A \nsickle cell anemia vaso-occlusive episode can cause a child or teen to experience priapism. \n\u203a\u203a\nTesticular torsion: The rotation and twisting of the spermatic cord, which causes extreme pain, swelling, and reduced blood \nflow to the scrotum. This condition requires surgical intervention.\n(continues)\n\t\nOther Pediatric Disorders of the Genitourinary System\t\n323\n", "TABLE 22-3\u2003\nDistinction Between Glomerulonephritis and Nephrotic Syndrome\nManifestations\nGlomerulonephritis\nNephrotic Syndrome\nStreptococcal antibody \ntiters\nPresent\nAbsent\nEdema\nPuffiness of face and eyes, especially in \nmorning; edema spreads during day to \nextremities and abdomen\nGeneralized\nSkin\nChild may appear pale; skin is warm to the \ntouch\nExtreme skin pallor; skin is warm to the touch \nand appears shiny\nWeight\nIncreased in acute stage\nIncreased from retention of sodium and water\nGastrointestinal \nsymptoms\nAnorexia, vomiting\nAnorexia, diarrhea, and malabsorption\nUrine analysis and output\nUrine is smoky brown, cloudy, and severely \nreduced in volume.

Later assessments will evaluate \nwhether the child is experiencing intrinsic factors affecting \nmobility, such as developmental motor delays, abnormal \nbone structures and gait, or scoliosis, as well as extrinsic \nfactors that may affect mobility, such as child abuse. If the \npediatric team suspects a disorder, further evaluation is \nwarranted, including the following steps:\n\u2022\t Radiographic assessment\n\u2022\t Bone scans\n\u2022\t Computed tomography (CT) scans\n\u2022\t Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\u2022\t Positron emission tomography (PET) scans\n\u2022\t Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\n\u2022\t Swallowing studies\nDevelopmental Perspectives on \nMobility-Related Issues\nSince each child is unique and develops on his or her own \ntimeline and sequence, the pediatric nurse must be able to \nidentify deviations in what would normally be expected \nduring each developmental state. For instance, a toddler \nwho is not walking by age 16 months should be referred \nfor further evaluation. It may be that the parents are overly \nprotective and not allowing or challenging the child to pro\u00ad\ngressively gain more locomotion, or it may be that muscle \nbiopsies are needed to check for muscular dystrophy. A child \nwith an awkward gait may need to be further assessed for \na neurologic disorder affecting the child\u2019s musculoskeletal \nsystem. A young teen with uneven shoulders and a rib hump \nshould be evaluated for scoliosis. The pediatric team must \nincorporate the assessment of developmental milestones, \nand normal or expected growth and development, into \neach well-child or sick-child encounter.\nCongenital and Idiopathic Disorders\nCongenital disorders of the musculoskeletal system are \nconditions that affect mobility and have been present \nsince birth. These disorders may develop while in utero, \nor they may occur during the birthing process. This sec\u00ad\ntion outlines four exemplars of congenital and idiopathic \ndisorders with the potential to affect mobility during \nchildhood: congenital hip dysplasia, spina bifida, club \nfoot, and scoliosis.\nCongenital Hip Dysplasia \n(Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip)\nIdentified as early as hours after birth, congenital hip \ndysplasia (CHD) affects the hip joint. Either the hip joint \nis shallow enough to allow the head of the femur to slip \nslightly (preluxation) from the acetabulum, or it is so \nIntroduction\nMobility\u2014a functional feature of anatomic develop\u00ad\nment that helps children explore and manipulate the \nenvironment\u2014is a key factor in growth and develop\u00ad\nment. After the newborn period, an infant develops the \nmusculoskeletal system by increasing strength, agility, and \nmovement. While the young infant\u2019s musculoskeletal sys\u00ad\ntem contains a complete set of 206 bones, and all muscles \nin place, myelination of central and peripheral nerves \nmust occur for the infant to transition from having reflex \nresponses only to slowly exhibiting purposeful movement, \ncoordination, and locomotion. Within the first year of \nlife, a child moves from a state of dependence and immo\u00ad\nbility, to learning to raise the head, roll over, sit up, and \nrapidly crawl, and then to walking.\nThe musculoskeletal system structures should be intact \nat birth. Through the process of maturation, cartilage \n(embryonic connective tissue) is replaced with osteoblasts \nvia ossification within bony structures. Progressing out\u00ad\nwardly from the diaphysis (hard shaft portion), ossification \nis required for bone strength. This process continues until \nthe child is in late adolescence, when skeletal maturation \nreaches completion.\nA young child\u2019s bones are more porous and less dense \nthan those of adults and, therefore, are more prone to \nfractures. Bones become strong and less pliable as the \nyoung child grows. After ossification, the bones grow via \nthe epiphyseal plate, or the growth plate. Muscles, as they \nmature through hypertrophy, provide greater stamina, \ncoordination, and strength to the growing child.\nDisorders affecting a child\u2019s musculoskeletal system can \nhave a major impact on how the child learns to engage in \nmobility, independence, and play. Pediatric nurses who \ninteract with children and their families should keenly \nassess how each child\u2019s musculoskeletal system matches \nup with the achievements expected for the child\u2019s devel\u00ad\nopmental stage. Early identification of motor delays, or \nearly identification of congenital or acquired disorders, \ncan initiate the management or treatments of many mus\u00ad\nculoskeletal conditions.\nAssessments for Issues in Mobility\nAssessment for congenital conditions starts with a new\u00ad\nborn\u2019s first evaluation. The interdisciplinary team works \nto identify disorders as early as possible. The initial as\u00ad\nsessment of a newborn should include an examination to \nidentify birth trauma, such as fracture of the collarbones, \nand congenital disorders such as club foot, congenital hip \ndysplasia, and limb-length discrepancies (i.e., differences \nin the lengths of the arms or the legs). A complete health \n330\t\nChapter 23\u2003 Mobility\n", "shallow that the femoral head can move around the hip \nsocket (subluxation). In the most extreme cases, the femoral \nhead is found out of the socket completely (dislocation). \nThe development of CHD is influenced by family history, \nin-utero positioning (frank breech), presentation of twins, \nnewborn\u2019s overall size, and oligohydramnios (Noordin, \nUmer, Hafeez, & Nawaz, 2010). Culturally, families who \nwrap and carry their newborns in a consistent abducted \nposition (legs together, straight) can also influence the \nextent of the condition after birth.\nDuring a newborn assessment, two techniques are \ntypically performed to assess for this condition. To assess \nfor Ortolani\u2019s sign, the child is placed in a supine posi-\ntion with the knees flexed 90 degrees (Figure 23-1). The \nprovider then places the pads of his or her fingers over \nthe greater trochanter, with the thumb placed internally \nat the upper thigh. While abducting the hip outward, a \npositive Ortolani\u2019s sign would be found if a clicking sound \nis heard while the femoral head is slipping back into the \nacetabulum. A positive Barlow\u2019s sign is identified when, \nusing the same technique but adducting the child\u2019s hip \njoint, the femoral head slips back out of the socket to a \nstate of dislocation (Figure 23-2). Other possible posi-\ntive findings are the Allis sign, where the nurse identifies \nunequal knee height in the newborn while lying in the \nsupine position, flexing the thighs in a 90-degree posi-\ntion toward the trunk, or the presence of unequal thigh \nskin folds while the newborn is supine and the thighs are \nflexed. The nurse who identifies any positive sign should \nreport the findings immediately so treatment can be initi-\nated. In an older child, the pediatric nurse may identify a \nslight limb-length discrepancy, history of delayed walking, \nwaddling gait, or presence of a limp.\nTreatment for CHD should be initiated within two \nmonths to attain the best outcomes. For young infants \n(less than 3 months of age), the pediatric team will place a \nPavlik harness to maintain a flexed and abducted position \nthat holds the femoral head into the acetabulum, so as to \ndeepen the socket contour as the child grows (Figure 23-3). \nThis device includes an adjustable strap system to allow \nfor rapid infant growth. Older infants and young children \nwill require skin traction, followed by the placement of a \nspica cast to hold the femoral head and acetabulum in the \ndesired abducted position (Figure 23-4).\nSpina Bifida\nCommonly associated with the neurologic system, spina \nbifida presents as a weakened area or gap in the bony \nFigure 23-1\u2002 Ortolani\u2019s sign.\nFigure 23-2\u2002 Barlow\u2019s sign.\nFigure 23-3\u2002 A Pavlik harness.\nCourtesy of International Hip Dysplasia Institute\n\t\nAssessments for Issues in Mobility\t\n331\n", "spinal column (posterior vertebral arches tail to fuse), \nwhich allows for either protrusion of the meninges and \ncerebral spinal fluid sac (meningocele) or protrusion of \nthe meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, and a portion of the \nspinal cord nerve roots (myelomeningocele). Spina bifida is \noften accompanied by other debilitating neurologic condi\u00ad\ntions (e.g., hydrocephalus, cognitive impairment), but an \nespecially important facet of this condition is that it leads \nto motor and sensory impairment, including bowel and \nbladder incontinence, below the level of the spinal lesion \n(Swaroop & Dias, 2015). Nursing care of the child with \nspina bifida focuses on improving mobility and function \nto the greatest degree possible and offering supportive \ncare to the child and family in maximizing quality of life \nthroughout the life span (Dicianno, Fairman, Juengst, \nBraun, & Zabel, 2010).\nClub Foot\nClub foot, in which the foot is twisted into an unusual \nposition, is a relatively common congenital defect, be\u00ad\ning present in 1 in 1000 births (Dobbs & Gurnett, 2012). \nAlthough four distinct deformities are all diagnosed as \nclub foot (Figure 23-5), the most common form of club \nfoot is talipes equinovarus, which accounts for more than \n95% of all childhood cases. In this case, the newborn pre\u00ad\nsents with a foot that has inward and downward rotation, \neither unilaterally or bilaterally. This congenital condi\u00ad\ntion is twice as common in boys as it is in girls. Although \nclub foot is associated with several risk factors\u2014such as \nFigure 23-5\u2002 Four forms of club foot: equinas, calcaneus, varus, \nand valgus.\nEquinas\nCalcaneus \nValgus\nVarus\nFigure 23-4\u2002 A spica cast on a young toddler.\nCourtesy of International Hip Dysplasia Institute\nfamilial tendencies, improper intrauterine positioning, \nmultiple fetuses, and neuromuscular pathologies\u2014no exact, \nconsistent etiology is known.\nIf treatment is initiated during the newborn period, a \nseries of small casts that are changed weekly can be placed \nthat slowly stretch the musculoskeletal structures into place. \nIf not corrected in the newborn period, or if the condition \nis severe, the older infant or child may need to wear cor\u00ad\nrective splints or corrective shoes. Foot bone realignment \nsurgery (with steel pins) will be required if splints, shoes, \nor casting is not successful.\nScoliosis\nScoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine with no known \netiology that is typically identified during the rapid growth \nperiod of adolescence, but in some instances manifests earlier \nand may be present from birth. It is typically classified into \none of three categories: congenital, neuromuscular, and \nidiopathic. Many children have no symptoms, but their \ncondition is identified during a routine health screening. \nHaving a preteen or teenager bend forward will assist in \nthe identification of the disorder, as it may be visualized \nas unequal shoulder height (rib hump), uneven hip align\u00ad\nment, and uneven scapula\u2014all of which demonstrate an \nabnormal lateral curvature of the spine region (Figure 23-6).\n332\t\nChapter 23\u2003 Mobility\n", "Nutritional Deficiencies Affecting the \nMusculoskeletal System\nNutrition and bone, muscle, and joint health are closely \nrelated. For a child to have a healthy musculoskeletal system \nwhile growing and thriving during the developmental pe\u00ad\nriod, he or she must be provided with appropriate nutrition \nthat supports the bones, muscles, and metabolic system. \nMetabolism, in general, influences the healthy growth of a \nchild. The metabolic system, including healthy endocrine \nglands, also influences the maturation, regulation, and \ngrowth and development of the musculoskeletal system. \nIn this way, it influences the achievement of locomo\u00ad\ntion mastery in infants and toddlers, and mobility status \nthroughout childhood.\nNutritional deficits must be identified early, and pro\u00ad\nfessional counsel by a nutritionist must be secured for \nimmediate interventions. Nutritional defects influencing \nmusculoskeletal development and mobility include insuf\u00ad\nficient intake of the following nutrients:\n\u2022\t Vitamin D: Plays a critical role in accrual of bone \nmass, bone matrix, and bone geometry, and regula\u00ad\ntion of calcium. Adequate levels of vitamin D also \ninfluence the decreased proliferation of osteoclast \nprecursors, which otherwise would cause bone \ndestruction (Fuleihan & Vieth, 2007).\n\u2022\t Calcium: Provides the major building blocks of \nbone tissue.\n\u2022\t Magnesium: Plays a critical role in forming bone \nminerals.\n\u2022\t Vitamin K: Required for mineralization of bone tis\u00ad\nsue. Low levels have been associated with fractures.\nIn case of mild to moderate scoliosis, the child will \nbe custom-fitted with a plastic thoracic lumbar spinal \northotic (TLSO) or a Milwaukee brace, which needs to \nbe worn up to 23 hours per day for 6 months to 2 years, \nwith complete compliance required to achieve the best \nresults (Figure 23-7). The brace should be removed only \nfor bathing. Daily skin assessments are required to monitor \nfor irritation, reddened areas, and breakdown from contact \nof the brace with the child\u2019s skin.\nIn severe scoliosis cases, such as with curvatures that \ncause pain or that impair ventilation or mobility, surgical \ncorrection with the placement of rods or wires via anterior \nand posterior thoracotomies will be required. The latest \nsurgical techniques include the use of biological cement to \nsecure the vertebral column in the desired straight alignment.\nAcquired Issues with Mobility\nCongenital issues represent one end of the spectrum of \nmobility disorders. At the other end, and by far more \ncommon, are acquired disorders. Musculoskeletal injuries, \nneurologic disease or damage, and nutritional deficits can \nall have long-term impacts on growth and development.\nFigure 23-6\u2002 Abnormal lateral curvature of the spine region may be \nvisualized as unequal shoulder height (rib hump), uneven hip align\u00ad\nment, and uneven scapula.\nUneven\nshoulders\nRib hump as\nvertebrae rotate\nUneven\nhips\nSevere scoliosis\nFigure 23-7\u2002 A Milwaukee brace.\n\t\nAcquired Issues with Mobility\t\n333\n", "deficient nutrient intake leads to several bony abnormalities \nfrom the weakening and softening of bone tissue. Findings \nassociated with prolonged and extreme deficient intake \ntypically include muscle weakness; delayed growth; pain \nin the legs, pelvis, and spine; and significant skeletal defor\u00ad\nmities. A child with rickets may display projection of the \nbreastbone, thickened ankles and wrists, and bowed legs \n(Figure 23-8). Children with clinical signs and symptoms \nof rickets must have adequate nutrition, to include calcium, \nvitamin D, and phosphates, as well as sunlight exposure \n(Casey, Slawson, & Neal, 2010).\nInjuries and Infections \nAffecting\u00a0Mobility\nChildren may develop mobility issues for a variety of reasons, \nincluding trauma and other injuries, bone tissue infections \n(osteomyelitis), or bone, muscle, or nerve damage secondary \nto other pathologies (e.g., declining mobility with autoim\u00ad\nmune destruction of peripheral nerves with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 \nsyndrome). Four syndromes\u2014cerebral palsy, Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy, dystonia, and Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes \ndisease\u2014that affect mobility via nontraumatic injury to \nmuscles, bones, or nerves are described in this section as \nexemplars of secondary damage that affects mobility; the \nremainder of the section focuses on traumatic injuries.\nChildren with lifelong mobility issues (e.g., wheelchair-\nbound children and those who need multiple corrective \nsurgeries) will require extensive interventions to assist \nthe family with managing home care. Education around \nexercise and nutrition to prevent obesity, for example, is \nan important aspect of assisting families in caring for a \n\u2022\t Zinc: Required for the renewal of bone tissue, es\u00ad\npecially after bone fractures or trauma.

Protein can be found in lean \nmeats, eggs, fish, and legumes (e.g., kidney beans \nand lentils), as well as grains, seeds, nuts, and tofu \nproducts.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nNutrition and Children\u2019s Physical Activity\nAccording to Janssen (2007), children who have the nutri\u00ad\ntional disorder of obesity are at high risk for complications \nassociated with their musculoskeletal system and mobility. \nModerate to vigorous physical activity during childhood is \nrequired to positively influence an obese child\u2019s quantity \nof adiposity, development of metabolic syndromes, high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels, \nand childhood blood pressure readings. In a dose-response \nstudy conducted by Strong et\u00a0al. (2005), the researchers \nfound that aerobic exercise for 30 to 40 minutes, 3 to 5 days \nper week, is required to successfully reduce adipose levels \nin children.\nFigure 23-8\u2002 Signs and symptoms of rickets.\nStunted growth\nOdd curve to \nspine or back\nWide joints at \nelbow and wrist\nOdd-shaped legs\nWide ankles\nWide bones\nLarge abdomen\nLarge forehead\nOdd-shaped ribs\nand breast bones\nRickets\nAnother disorder stemming from nutritional inadequacy \nis rickets.

In this country, the vitamin D deficiency \nthat predisposes most children to rickets is most frequently \nseen in overweight and obese children, particularly those \nwho live in northern states, who are dark-skinned, and \nwho spend little time outdoors (Turer, Lin, & Flores, 2013).\nRickets develops after prolonged and extreme nutri\u00ad\ntional deficiencies.

This recessive \ndisorder is linked to a mutation on the X chromosome, \nand leads to progressive skeletal muscle abnormalities \nin children. The genetic mutation leads to an absence \nof the essential protein dystrophin, which then triggers \na process of severe inflammation that induces muscle \nfiber necrosis.\nThe most typical age of clinical presentation of Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy is during the preschool period, from \n3 to 4 years of age. Children who were previously mobile \nbegin to display muscle weakness, especially in the muscles \nof the hip girdle. They may display the classic Gower\u2019s \nsign, in which the child, with great difficulty, uses arm \nmuscles for assistance when rising from a supine position \n(Figure 23-9). Other musculoskeletal abnormalities include \ncontractures, hypertrophy of lower limb (calf) muscles, \ntip-toe walking, waddling gait, and development of con\u00ad\ntractures. Muscle biopsies are performed to confirm the \ndecreased production or absence of the protein dystrophin \nand subsequent infiltration of fatty material into the muscle \nareas.\nCardiomyopathy and respiratory failure are the leading \ncauses of death in individuals with Duchenne muscular \ndystrophy, most of whom do not survive past age 20. Assist\u00ad\ning families with coping, both in terms of acknowledging \nthe clinical course and experiencing it, is an essential aspect \nof family-centered nursing care in such cases: Nearly 70% \nof family caregivers report significant mental health issues \n(Landfeldt et\u00a0al., 2016).\nMedical management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy \nincludes surgical interventions for contractures, physical \ntherapy, occupational therapy, braces and other mobility \nchild with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Christensen & \nKockrow, 2013). Nursing interventions to ease caregiver \nburden are of significant importance.\nNontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders \nAffecting\u00a0Mobility\nCerebral Palsy\nAlthough generally categorized as a neuromuscular \ndisorder, cerebral palsy is also associated with muscular \ndisabilities. Cerebral palsy is defined as a nonprogressive \ncentral nervous disorder that impacts movement, mus\u00ad\ncular control, and often posture. Owing to a brain injury \nthat occurs during or after birth, the child experiences \na significant brain anoxia that leads to disrupted brain \ndevelopment. Growth failures, cognitive disabilities, \nfeeding issues, speech delays or disorders, hearing and \nvisual impairments, and possibly seizure disorders have \nall been associated with cerebral palsy. Risk factors for \nthe development of cerebral palsy and subsequent mus\u00ad\nculoskeletal sequelae include birth asphyxia, postnatal \nhemorrhage, stroke, intrauterine infections, kernicterus, \npostnatal infection, and birth trauma.\nIn children with cerebral palsy, the musculoskeletal sys\u00ad\ntem can be affected by asymmetrical reflexes, exaggerated \nreflexes, hypertonicity, spasms, involuntary movements \n(dyskinesias), rigidity in the neck and back area (dystonia), \nscissoring of lower extremities, difficulty with gait, and \npoor control over arm and hand movements, especially \nwhen reaching for an object. Medical treatments for these \nmusculoskeletal effects during childhood include surgical \nrhizotomy to reduce spasticity, surgery to muscle\u2012tendon \ngroups to increase limb movement, bracing and position\u00ad\ning devices, and injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to \ndecrease muscle spasticity.\nFigure 23-9\u2002 Gower\u2019s sign.\n\t\nInjuries and Infections Affecting\u00a0Mobility\t\n335\n", "Common Childhood Injuries: Strains, \nSprains, and Fractures\nIt is very common to see pediatric clients in healthcare \nsettings for soft-tissue injuries that affect mobility or frac\u00ad\ntures. Sprains, strains, and overuse syndromes of joints and \nsoft tissues are very common during the developmental \nperiod. Notably, child athletes and children who attempt \na new sport or activity in which they stress their muscu\u00ad\nloskeletal system can experience a variety of injuries that \naffect mobility (Table 23-1). Nevertheless, the healthcare \nprovider should never assume that fractures stem from \ncommon childhood accidents. Some fractures, such as \nspiral fractures in very young children, have a high index \nof suspicion for child maltreatment. Others may suggest \nan underlying \u201chidden\u201d disorder such as osteomalacia or \nprimary hyperparathyroidism (Ganie et\u00a0al., 2016). If the \netiology of a fracture seems questionable due to inconsis\u00ad\ntencies in the history or presentation, the nurse should \nkeep in mind other possible etiologies and explore further.\nMost injuries bring only short-term limitations in \nmobility. A child with a minor fracture from falling on a \ntrampoline, for example, should return to full mobility in \nweeks or months, depending on how severe the injury is \nand how well the child and his or her caregivers follow the \ntreatment plan. As described later in this chapter, teaching \nfamilies how to correctly change dressings (in cases where \na wrap dressing is used) and how to manage hard casts is \nan important part of ensuring rapid and thorough healing \nwithout complications.\nSevere injuries or trauma involving multiple fractures \ncan be considerably more challenging. Important consid\u00ad\nerations for nursing care include ensuring optimal pain \nmanagement (children are often undertreated for pain), \nassessing skin integrity and avoiding bed sores for bed\u00ad\nridden children, identifying the potential for long-term \nmobility issues (particularly in patients with spinal or \nhead injuries), and assisting the family in providing for \nthe child\u2019s continued well-being and education during \nwhat may be a protracted convalescence. Nursing care \nproviders should be alert to signs of post-traumatic stress \nin children who have undergone severe physical trauma \n(Marsac et\u00a0al., 2014).\nSlipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis\nOccurring most frequently during periods of very rapid \ngrowth, slipped capital femoral epiphysis develops when \nthe upper section of the femoral epiphysis slips from its \nnormal position, leading to an acute and painful slip of the \nfemoral head at the site of the femoral head\u2019s epiphyseal \ngrowth plate. The child suddenly develops a painful limp, \nmay complain of pain radiating down the affected leg, \nand cannot or refuses to bear weight. Treatment must be \ndevices, and ventilation support as needed. Pharmacotherapy \nsupport includes corticosteroid administration to slow \nthe muscle weakness progression, as well as angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers to \nslow the progression of cardiomyopathy.\nDystonia\nChildren with a diagnosis of dystonia demonstrate sustained \nmuscle contractions. They may display tense muscled, \nrepetitive movements and, in older children, abnormal \npostures due to this muscle disorder. According to the \nDystonia Society (2011), there is no single etiology for \nthis condition; instead, researchers have associated it more \ngenerally with either a medical condition, such as severe \ntrauma at birth, or a genetic predisposition. Determining \nthe etiology in a specific case may require extensive workup, \nbut it may be necessary because some causes of dystonia \nare treatable (Van Egmond et\u00a0al., 2014).\nThe presence of dystonia is considered a physical \ndisability, as a child\u2019s normal play, social, and academic \nexperiences can be affected. Several types of dystonias are \ndistinguished, with the most common being generalized \ndystonia (affecting most of the body), hemidystonia (affect\u00ad\ning one side of the body), myoclonus dystonia (where the \nchild displays jerking movements), paroxysmal dystonia \n(found anywhere on the body but lasts only brief moments), \nand dopa-responsive dystonia (a rare form that has been \nknown to respond positively to the medication levodopa, \nwhich is also used in treating Parkinson\u2019s disease). Other \ncategories of dystonia include \u201ctask-specific\u201d types, such \nas musician\u2019s cramp and writer\u2019s cramp, and acquired dys\u00ad\ntonia, such as that associated with metabolic dysfunctions, \ndrug-induced dystonia symptoms, brain injury dystonia, \nand cerebral palsy.\nLegg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes Disease\nMarked by avascular necrosis of the femoral head, \nLegg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease is considered a self-limiting \ndisorder in childhood. Boys are affected by this disease \nfour times more often than girls, and Caucasians are af\u00ad\nfected 10\u00a0times more often than African Americans. The \ncause of the avascular condition is unknown but may be \nrelated to trauma.\nThe more rapid the identification of the pathology \nand the beginning of treatment for Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes \ndisease, the better the long-term prognosis. Typically, the \nchild presents with a limp, aching pain and stiffness, and \ngreater symptoms with activity and late-daytime periods. \nAfter diagnosis, the child is placed on bed rest, traction is \napplied to hold the structures in place, and eventually the \napplication of non-weight-bearing devices such as casts \nand braces are applied while the tissues heal.\n336\t\nChapter 23\u2003 Mobility\n", "TABLE 23-1\u2003\nTypes of Fractures\n\u203a\u203a\nSimple \nclosed\n\u203a\u203a\nComminuted\n\u203a\u203a\nIncomplete\n\u203a\u203a\nGreenstick\n\u203a\u203a\nComplete\n\u203a\u203a\nBend\n\u203a\u203a\nCompound \n(open)\n\u203a\u203a\nBuckle\n\u203a\u203a\nCompression\n\u203a\u203a\nSpiral\ninitiated promptly, including immobility via bed rest until \nsurgery is performed.\nChild Abuse: Spiral Fractures\nAlthough not always associated with child abuse, a classic \nspiral fracture finding via radiography on the upper limbs \nor, more commonly, on the lower limbs should prompt the \npediatric healthcare team to conduct an expanded health \nhistory and physical exam assessing for further evidence of \nchild abuse. Such an injury occurs when a rotating force is \napplied along the long axis of a child\u2019s bone; hence, spiral \nfractures are also referred to as torsion fractures.\nAccidental spiral fractures often occur when the child is \nin motion, as one foot remains fixed on the floor or some \nstationary surface but the other extremities continue in mo\u00ad\ntion. Such fractures can be seen in older infants and young \nchildren who experience falls (off countertops, changing \ntables, high chairs, and play structures) that fracture the \ntibia. Preschool children who fall from heights onto a leg \nthat is extended can experience a spiral fracture.\nWhen a pediatric healthcare team finds a spiral frac\u00ad\nture in an infant or young toddler, intentional injury must \nalways be ruled out. Notably, forceful twisting\u2014such as \npicking up a young child by the ankle and causing a jerk\u00ad\ning, twisting motion, sometimes with impact\u2014can cause \nspiral fractures (Lukefahr, 2008).\nUse of Traction in Children\nTraction is often used as a treatment for young children \nand school-age children who present with a significant \nfracture. Traction can be used solely as a treatment, or it \ncan be used preoperatively or postoperatively in prepara\u00ad\ntion for surgical repair or after the application of surgical \nhardware to keep a limb immobile to promote healing. \nIn general, there are three main purposes for applying \ntraction: (1) to align the fractured limb or body part in \npreparation for casting, splinting, or surgical stabilization; \n(2) to reduce muscle spasms and tremors associated with \nbone fractures to promote healing and illicit fatigue of \nmuscle groups that are having spasms; or (3) to place the \nfractured sites together to immobilize them and allow the \nends to heal and strengthen.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nSuspicious Fractures\nAny fracture confirmed via radiography in children six months \nor younger should raise suspicion for an intentional child abuse \ninjury. Due to these children\u2019s limited mobility, it is unlikely that \nthey would fall from a distance sufficient to create enough \nimpact to cause a significant fracture. Although such a scenario \nis possible, further history and physical examination should \nfocus on identifying the possibility of child abuse.\nSpiral fractures found in non-ambulatory young children \nare associated with intentional harm. The force required \nto produce this type of fracture in a non-ambulatory child \nwould require holding the child by the knee, ankle, or elbow \nand causing a forceful twisting, with or without impact to a \nsurface such as the floor or a wall.\n\t\nUse of Traction in Children\t\n337\n", "\u2022\t Lower-extremity traction\n\u2022\t Bryant\u2019s traction\n\u2022\t Buck\u2019s extension\n\u2022\t Russell\u2019s traction\n\u2022\t Dunlop traction\n\u2022\t Halo brace\nThe child\u2019s traction setup may provide three types of \nforce. First, a forward pulling force may be used to reduce \nthe dislocation of the fracture and realign the two surface \nsites. Second, a counter-force, also called backward pull, \nmay use the child\u2019s weight as an anchor. Third, a frictional \nforce may be established in which the child\u2019s body on the bed \nsurface contributes to the stabilization of the traction setup.\nTypes of Traction\nThe type of traction ordered to treat a child\u2019s fracture de\u00ad\npends on the child\u2019s size, age, and fracture experienced. In \ngeneral, two types of traction are applied: skeletal or skin.\nSkeletal traction is the surgical placement of anchoring \ndevices such as pins, wires, plates, screws, and other metal \nhardware needed to hold fractured surfaces together to \npromote healing. Traction setups typically require a forward \nforce, but using water bags, sand bags, or weights has also \nbeen determined to be sufficient to provide a pull to keep \nthe fractured sites in place.\nSkin traction uses stabilizing materials (dressings) to \nhold the fractured limb in preparation for the application \nof a traction setup. It is used with lesser degrees of fracture \ncomplexity and minimal displacement of fractured surfaces. \nIn such a case, bandages are used to wrap the afflicted limb, \nthereby providing a pull on the skin, muscle, and overall limb.\nAnother way to remember traction types concerns \nwhere the fracture is located:\n\u2022\t Pelvic traction\n\u2022\t Cervical traction\n\u2022\t Upper-extremity traction\n338\t\nChapter 23\u2003 Mobility\n", "is not without concerns. Casting a fracture during childhood \nrequires meticulous assessments, care, and parent teach\u00ad\ning. The five most common complications associated with \ncasting are pain, skin abrasions, skin breakdown leading to \nulcers, thermal injuries during application, and injuries to \nthe afflicted sites neurologic system (Harp, 2005).\nIn rarer situations, the development of a deep vein throm\u00ad\nbosis or compartment syndrome may occur. Measurement \nof compartment pressures is necessary if compartment \nsyndrome is suspected. Children with acute-onset pain \nor changes in neurologic sensations at and distal to the \nsite should be assessed for the development of bleeding or \ninflammatory fluids leaking into muscles bundles, thereby \nincreasing pressure in those areas. Without intervention, \ncompartment syndrome can lead to ischemia, necrosis, \nand loss of limb. Other extreme complications of extremity \ninjuries associated with splinting, casting, and orthopedic \ntreatments include toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing \nfasciitis (Delasobera, Place, Howell, & Davis, 2011).\nFamily Education for a Child in a Brace or Cast\nWith the variety of braces and casts that are used for pediatric \npatients who experience a fracture or musculoskeletal injury \nor disorder, family teaching will be required. Placement of \nthe brace or cast is performed by the medical team, and \nthe essential teaching on care of the child and his or her \ndevice is reinforced by the pediatric nurse. Seven key points \nshould be covered before the family takes charge of the \nchild\u2019s care, and it is imperative that appropriate language \nand level of health literacy be taken into account during \nthis education so the child can experience a positive and \ntimely healing process.\n\u2022\t 90-90 degree femoral traction\n\u2022\t External fixators such as the Ilizarov device\nBEST PRACTICES\nAssessment Findings Requiring Immediate \nReporting\nChildren who, either verbally or nonverbally, demonstrate a \nchange in neurologic or circulatory status while being treated \nfor a fracture or other musculoskeletal disorder must have \nthe change reported.

Teach the family not to use lotions, \npowder, or any creams near the cast. Explain that \nthe child must never put any object into the cast \nor brace, or use a stick or long object to scratch the \nskin under the device. The cast must be kept dry, \nand the cast edges may need to be covered with \nwater-proof tape or plastic to keep moisture out.\n\u2022\t In the beginning of the cast or brace placement, \nteach the family to adhere to any movement or \nactivity restrictions, such as weight bearing or use \nof\u00a0a sling for support and immobilization.\n\u2022\t For certain musculoskeletal disorder treatments, \nsuch as serial casting for club foot or lengthy man\u00ad\nagement via harnesses (e.g., spica casts or Pavlik har\u00ad\nness for congenital hip dysplasia) or orthotics (e.g., \nthoracolumbosacral orthosis [TLSO] for scoliosis), \nthe pediatric nurse must teach the family exactly \nwhich follow-up appointments will be required. \nLength of treatment must be understood and follow-\nup for any device issues or adjustments must be set.\n\u2022\t Teach the family about immediate care of the newly \napplied cast or brace.

Typically, a fiberglass casts dries in less than \n30 minutes, whereas a plaster cast does not com\u00ad\npletely set for 24 to 48 hours. If the child is placed \nin a brace, the healthcare team and family should \nassess for the child\u2019s immediate response to the \nplacement of the device.

For example, naloxone may be \nadministered for narcotic reversal (Figure 24-1). Other \nIntroduction\nCognition and mental health are grouped together as inter\u00ad\nrelated concepts. Cognition, or the child\u2019s mental capacity \nand awareness, is directly linked to the child\u2019s mental \nhealth state. Interwoven with mental health and cognitive \nprocessing is the child\u2019s thinking about the world and the \nmeaning of his or her existence. Both of these concepts \nare discussed in this chapter.\nCognition\nA child\u2019s cognition is loosely defined as his or her level of \nawareness. This term denotes a child\u2019s ability to take in and \nprocess sensory stimuli, and then react. A child\u2019s cognition \ncan be considered to be based on several factors, including \nhealth state, developmental level (Box 24-1), presence of \ndisease, intelligence quotient (IQ), personal challenges, \nand family dynamics. More generally, one can consider \ncognition as the child\u2019s ability to respond to external stimuli \n(sensory) such as pain and temperature and touch, as well \nas intellectual or developmental stimuli.\nMany factors can lead to a decline in a child\u2019s cognitive \nstatus, including metabolic disease, altered brain chemistry, \ndiabetes mellitus, uremia, alteration in serum sodium (hy\u00ad\npernatremia or hyponatremia), drug toxicity, lead poisoning, \nchanges in core body temperature, stroke, central nervous \nsystem infections, sepsis, after-seizure (postictal) state, and \nincreased intracranial pressure. Social factors influencing \nchild\u2019s delayed cognitive processing may include chronic \nstress, anxiety, a poorly stimulating environment, social \nisolation, and child maltreatment.\nBOX 24-1\u2002 Piaget\u2019s Stages of Cognitive Development\nAccording to Jean Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development, \na child works through and masters a series of age-related \nphases in a sequential and orderly manner, with each phase \ncomprising challenges of mastering increasingly difficult sets \nof tasks. Piaget\u2019s theory includes four stages:\n\u2022\t Sensorimotor (age 0\u20132): The child learns to move and \ninteract with sensory stimuli over the first two years \nof life.\n\u2022\t Preoperational (age 2\u20137): The child\u2019s egocentric self \nmoves to social awareness, animism (the attribution \nof a soul or consciousness or being to an inanimate \nobject), and magical thinking.\n\u2022\t Concrete operations (age 7\u201311): The child learns about \nconservation of matter and the process of cause and \neffect.\n\u2022\t Formal operations (age 11\u201318): The child develops \nabstract thinking, achieves intellectual mental pro\u00ad\ncessing, and masters the ability to consider various \noutcomes to situations (which, in turn, greatly influ\u00ad\nences safety and adult decision making).\nBEST PRACTICES\nA\nny change of cognition, or consciousness, should be \nreported immediately and further diagnostics undertaken. \nContinued change in cognition can be a progressive and \nlife-threatening event requiring medical evaluation and treat\u00ad\nment. Any cognitive developmental delay must be referred \nfor evaluation.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nLevels of Consciousness\nAs part of the concept of human awareness, determining a \nchild\u2019s level of consciousness is a nurse\u2019s responsibility as a \nmember of the healthcare team\u2014and often the one who \nengages in the most prolonged child\u2013team member inter\u00ad\nactions. The levels of a child\u2019s consciousness are presented \nhere in order of increasing severity:\n\u2022\t Fully conscious and aware and alert\n\u2022\t Lethargy\n\u2022\t Obtunded\n\u2022\t Stupor\n\u2022\t Coma\nAssessments of a child\u2019s cognitive ability cover two gen\u00ad\neral areas. First, assessment considers the ability to process \nsensory stimulation, where a child\u2019s level of consciousness \ncan be determined (i.e., painful stimuli). Second, assessment \naddresses the child\u2019s intellectual ability or capacity. Tools \nfor assessing the sensory-based level of cognition include \nreflexes, pain responses, ability to swallow and cough, and \ngag reflexes. Tools for assessing level of consciousness are \nvaried but are based on the assessment of awareness and \nlevel of ability to respond to stimuli.\n344\t\nChapter 24\u2003 Cognition and Mental Health\n", "sources of support or reversal include the administration \nof oxygen, thiamine, and glucose, and chelation therapy \nfor heavy metal poisoning.\nCognitive Impairment\nThe term cognitive impairment is used to describe a child\u2019s \noverall mental deficiency or mental difficulty. This broad \nterm denotes many different lower-than-expected states of \nmental processing. Risk factors associated with cognitive \nimpairment include brain trauma, microcephaly, metabolic \ndisorders, chronic lead exposure, congenital rubella or \nsyphilis, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Due to the social stigma \nattached to the previously used term \u201cmental retardation,\u201d \n\u201ccognitive impairment\u201d is now the preferred terminology.\nThe diagnosis of cognitive impairment in a child is based \non objective data collected to compare a child\u2019s current \nmental processing with the behaviors and mental process\u00ad\ning expected for the child\u2019s age and developmental level. The \nclinical presentation of cognitive impairment can range from \nmild to quite severe. Parents, childcare providers, or health \nprofessionals may be the first to recognize a delay in expected \nmotor and developmental milestones. Early clinical mani\u00ad\nfestations include decreased alertness, delay in gross motor \ndevelopment, delay or absence of language development, \nfeeding issues, and abnormal responses to physical contact \nor eye contact. A child who displays any of these symptoms \nshould be referred for professional assessment and the deter\u00ad\nmination of the cause and severity of cognitive impairment.\nTreatment for cognitive impairment is based on the \netiology and probability for improvement. After the child\u2019s \nlevel of deficiency is determined, the family should imme\u00ad\ndiately be referred to a regional early intervention program \nbased on the child\u2019s level of development (not the child\u2019s \nage). Referrals for speech therapy, occupational therapy, \nand physical therapy should be made as appropriate. The \nassistance of a social worker should be secured to help the \nfamily navigate resources, obtain financial assistance for the \nchild\u2019s care as needed, and investigate supportive services \nsuch as transportation, housing (if needed), and support \nfor siblings and family dynamics. A social worker can also \nassist with securing the best educational program for the \nchild\u2019s level of impairment. The overall focus of treatment \nfor the child is improving his or her social behaviors such \nas communication, social activities, and appropriate play. \nFamilies should help the child with self-care behaviors and \nthe promotion of healthy relationships.\nMental Health Issues in Children\nThe incidence of mental health issues, concerns, and \ndiagnoses is on the rise both in the United States and \nworldwide (Olfson, Blanco, Wang, Laje, & Correll, 2014). \nToday\u2019s children have more concerns with depression, \nanxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other psychiatric \ndisorders than their historical counterparts. The overall \nincidence of mental health issues in children is now 13% \nto 20% and is increasing (Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention [CDC], 2013). Pediatric registered nurses, as \npart of an interdisciplinary team, can play an integral role in \nthe early identification, referral, assessment, and treatment \nand management of children with mental health issues.\nLevels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, \nand participation in risky behaviors are believed to be \nincreasing due to the current social milieu, which includes \nthe social pressures of bullying, pressure to participate in \nhigh-risk behaviors, violence in communities, economic \nconcerns leading to unemployment, and stressors on fami\u00ad\nlies (Abma, Martinez, & Copen, 2010; CDC, 2010; Kirby & \nLepore, 2007). Children are highly vulnerable to these \npressures. They respond and react to their life experiences \nwith keen awareness, such that stressors can greatly affect \ntheir mood and state of being. Children are also vulnerable \nto the influence of genetics, family tendencies, and family \nhistory of severe mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder, \nschizophrenia, and severe depressive disorders. During any \npediatric healthcare interaction, members of the pediatric \nteam must be aware of the child\u2019s cognitive, behavioral, and \nemotional states so that early detection of mental health \nissues will be ensured and treatment can be initiated.\nThe following organizations are three excellent sources \nof information on the wide variety of mental health issues \nduring childhood:\n\u2022\t MentalHealth.gov: http://www.mentalhealth.gov\n\u2022\t National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH): \nhttp://www.nimh.nih.gov\n\u2022\t National Library of Medicine\u2019s Medline Plus: \nhttp://www.medlineplus.gov\nFigure 24-1\u2002 Naloxone.\nB Christopher / Alamy Stock Photo \n\t\nMental Health Issues in Children\t\n345\n", "Many well-accepted, reliable, and valid tools are avail\u00ad\nable to assess for depression in children, including the \nChildren\u2019s Depression Rating Scale and the Children\u2019s \nDepression Inventory. The pediatric nurse should assess \nfor the following symptoms and report their presence to \nthe pediatric team, with immediate referral of the child \nfor specialized mental health services:\n\u2022\t Depressed mood state\n\u2022\t Poor hygiene and/or a significant change in appear\u00ad\nance, dress, and weight (gain or loss)\n\u2022\t Feelings of low self-worth\n\u2022\t Inability to feel joy or pleasure (anhedonia) and \nlack of desire for play and peer interaction\n\u2022\t Difficulty with academic performance or poor \nconcentration\n\u2022\t Changes in relationships with family and friends\n\u2022\t Suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation (preoccupa\u00ad\ntion with suicide), suicide gesture (an attempt at \nself-harm that is suggestive of suicide, but in which \nthe person does not intend to die), or suicide \nattempt (an unsuccessful attempt to commit \nsuicide, in which the person survives)\nMany associate the teenage period with concerns of \nsuicidal thoughts and attempts, but the pediatric nurse \nmust recognize that school-age children also experience \nsuicidal thinking and acts. Most important, the pediatric \nnurse and all members of the healthcare team must be able \nto recognize the warning signs of suicide (Table 24-1). If \nthe child is suspected of harboring thoughts of suicide, \nthe pediatric nurse\u2014no matter what the practice setting \nDepression\nDepression\u2014that is, sadness\u2014is a normal part of life, often \nsituational in nature and based on circumstances that war\u00ad\nrant deep feelings of despair. A child who loses a parent, \nsibling, or best friend may fall into a depressive state. Even \nthe loss of a treasured pet may cause a situational state of \ndepression. These circumstances may elicit depressive signs \nand symptoms of a limited duration, followed eventually \nby a return to full functionality.\nIn contrast, the term depression, when used in refer\u00ad\nence to the clinically diagnosed mental health disorder, \ndenotes a persistent mood disorder that is characterized \nby an ongoing state of sadness and loss of interest in life \nactivities; for some children, it can profoundly impact their \nability to function on a daily basis (Figure 24-2). Only a \nspecialized medical professional can diagnose depression as \na disorder in children. Children with a documented history \nof clinical depression require treatment. Counseling and \nsometimes the administration of antidepressant medica\u00ad\ntions are required to assist a child battling depression.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nSelf-Esteem in Children\nSelf-esteem is defined as how one feels about oneself. Low or \nnegative self-esteem can lead children to believe that they do \nnot deserve love and support, and to perceive that they are \ngenerally not good at things when situations tend to work \nout poorly. Building self-esteem is a very crucial part of every \nchild\u2019s development.\nAccording to psychiatrist Heinz Kohut, the development \nof self-esteem is achieved, in part, through maternal \u201cmirror\u00ad\ning\u201d of the young child. That is, the mother (or other parent/\nguardian) fulfills the child\u2019s innate need for approval and \nvalidation through the process of mirroring, helping to \nsolidify the child\u2019s sense of self (Clark, 1999; \u201cHeinz Kohut\u2019s \nSelf Psychology: An Overview,\u201d 1987).\nHow children play, interact with other people, show \nconfidence, admit mistakes, learn, and problem-solve are \nall influenced by their self-esteem. When children have low \nself-esteem, they tend to have no pride in their work, have \na negative image of themselves on many levels, compare \nthemselves (physically, emotionally, and intellectually) against \nothers, and tend to struggle in making and keeping friends. \nLow self-esteem has been directly linked to depression, \nself-destructive and self-harm behaviors, anxiety, and other \nmental health issues (Orth & Robins, 2013; YoungMinds, 2016). \nEncouraging families to assess their child\u2019s emerging self-\nesteem, and being aware of how important self-esteem is to \nthe child\u2019s current and long-term success in life, is important \nto the child\u2019s sense of well-being.\nFigure 24-2\u2002 For some children, depression can profoundly impact \ntheir ability to function on a daily basis.\n\u00a9 Sabphoto/Shutterstock\n346\t\nChapter 24\u2003 Cognition and Mental Health\n", "Anxiety\nAnxiety is the most common mental illness in children \n(Merikangas et\u00a0al., 2010). Children with anxiety have \nthe potential to display unique symptoms. Restlessness, \nor healthcare institution\u2014must immediately report the \nchild\u2019s suicidal thoughts or behaviors to the interdisciplinary \nteam and nursing administration, and then implement all \nsafety precautions needed to protect the child from acting \non suicidal impulses. An assessment of lethality should \nbe conducted to determine if the child\u2019s suicidal plan has \nprogressed to a time, place, and method. If the child is truly \nat risk for suicide, protective custody may be warranted.\nTreatment for Depression\nDue to the high-risk nature of this psychiatric condition, \ntreatment of depression in children is addressed via a \nthree-pronged approach. Children will need the services \nof a mental health counselor or therapist to help them \ndetermine the causes of their feelings of hopelessness, \nunhappiness, and possibly loneliness (feelings of dejec\u00ad\ntion) in their lives and relationships, as well as to help \nthem determine positive coping strategies to deal with \neach causative factor. Medication may be necessary if the \ndepression is deep and prolonged. Finally, the family will \nneed support to best understand their child\u2019s behaviors, \nfeelings, and needs.\nBecause childhood depression can be short term, situ\u00ad\national, or prolonged, a professional child mental health \nspecialist should be involved in the assessment, manage\u00ad\nment, and treatment of any child with depression. Ensur\u00ad\ning the child\u2019s safety is imperative, and the progression \nof depression to suicidal behaviors must be evaluated. \nPotential treatment modalities for the child\u2019s depression \ninclude psychotherapy, family therapy, cognitive therapy, \nenvironmental therapy, psychiatric therapy with medica\u00ad\ntion, and educational therapy concerning personal coping \nstrategies and skill development (Figure 24-3).\nTABLE 24-1\u2003\nClassic Warning Signs of Suicide in Children\n\u203a\u203a\nDepression\n\u203a\u203a\nMajor life stressors\n\u203a\u203a\nTalking of taking one\u2019s life\n\u203a\u203a\nAnother suicide in the child\u2019s community\n\u203a\u203a\nAcademic failure\n\u203a\u203a\nSevere mood swings\n\u203a\u203a\nChange in personal appearance, hygiene, and eating \nbehaviors\n\u203a\u203a\nSignificant losses (deaths) in the family or social \ncommunity\n\u203a\u203a\nWithdrawn behaviors, social isolation, change in \nbehaviors and relationships\n\u203a\u203a\nGiving away meaningful possessions\nFigure 24-3\u2002 Potential treatment modalities for a child\u2019s depression \ninclude various types of therapy.\n\u00a9 Photographee.eu/Shutterstock\nPHARMACOLOGY\nWarnings on Use of Antidepressant \nMedications in Children\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the \nprimary types of medications used for treatment and sup\u00ad\nport of children with depression. Two SSRIs are specifically \napproved for pediatric use:\n\u2022\t Sertraline (Zoloft)\n\u2022\t Fluoxetine (Prozac)\nTwo other medications in this class, paroxetine (Paxil) and \nbupropion (Wellbutrin), are not approved for use in children \nbecause they carry a higher risk of suicidal thinking.\nFamily education on these medications includes the \nfollowing points:\n\u2022\t Never stop the medication abruptly; talk to the pre\u00ad\nscribing pediatric specialist before taking the child off \nthe medication.\n\u2022\t Understand the increased risk for suicidal ideation \nduring the early phase of taking these medications; \nmonitor for signs of suicide discussions, planning, or \nbehaviors.\n\u2022\t Become familiar with the adverse side effects of the \nmedications. Mild effects include headache, sleep \nproblems, nausea, and restlessness. Severe side effects \ninclude suicidal thoughts and actions and the devel\u00ad\nopment of depression resistant to medications.\n\u2022\t Know when to expect therapeutic effectiveness to \nbegin, as each medication has an average length of \ntime before its full therapeutic value is seen.\n\t\nMental Health Issues in Children\t\n347\n", "cognitive-behavioral therapy are generally preferred over \nmedications for this reason, but a combination of psycho\u00ad\ntherapy and medication is sometimes used (James, James, \nCowdrey, Soler, & Choke, 2013).\ndifficulty concentrating, being irritable or fatigued, and \nfeeling insecure or powerless are common descriptions of a \nchild\u2019s experience of anxiety. Physical symptoms of anxiety \nmay include headaches, tremors, shakiness, shortness of \nbreath, gastrointestinal distress, sweating, and palpitations. \nYoung children with anxiety disorder may be very clingy \nand unable to adapt to new situations and new people. \nThey may show regressive behaviors such as thumb sucking \nnot only as an attempt to soothe their emotional state but \nalso to gain attention from caregivers (Field, McCabe, & \nSchneiderman, 2013). Other symptoms may develop that \ncause difficulty for those around the child with anxiety, \nincluding aggressiveness, refusing to follow instructions \nor behave, refusing to eat, and crying.\nAnxiety is a mental health issue that requires assess\u00ad\nment, treatment and management. The disorder can be \nso severe that children experience anxiety every time \nthey leave their home, leading to academic failure; poor \nrelationships with peers, teachers, and family; and physical \nsequelae. Tremendous feelings of doom can cause a child \nto experience significant palpitations and impairments of \nfunctioning.

Considered a group of developmental disabilities \nwith an unknown origin, autism spectrum disorder causes \nsignificant impairment in three domains: communication \n(social interactions), repetitive behaviors, and imaginative \nplay. It becomes evident in almost all cases by a child\u2019s third \nbirthday, but consensus on a well-accepted etiology of this \nmental disorder has not been achieved. Possible etiologies \nthat are being investigated include biochemical influences, \n348\t\nChapter 24\u2003 Cognition and Mental Health\n", "There is a range of early screening tools available to \nassess young children for autism. Table 24-3 lists both \nautism-specific screening tools and social/communica\u00ad\ntion screening tools that are often used to supplement \ndiagnostic interviews. To make the diagnosis of autism, \na child must have 8 of 16 identifying characteristics, and \nhave characteristics in three categories: inability to relate, \nimpaired communication skills, and limited activities or \nrepetitive behaviors (Figure 24-4). Although there are no \ntreatments to cure autism, early developmental interven\u00ad\ntions and psychotherapy, starting as early as 18 months, \nhave been shown to improve a child\u2019s autistic behaviors \n(Bradshaw, Steiner, Gengoux, & Koegel, 2015). Medications \nthat have been trialed for this disorder include lithium, \nneuroleptics, and stimulants.\nThe focus of care for children with autism is to as\u00ad\nsist them in their daily function. Current interventions \ninclude consistent routines, consistent environments, \nlimit-setting for unacceptable behaviors, and encourage\u00ad\nment of verbalization and eye contact.

Parents, who \ntend to see their children achieve high function in \nsome areas and intellectual normalcy, can become quite \nfrustrated when their child with Asperger\u2019s syndrome \ndemonstrates social deficits. One predicament parents \nface is that their child may be high functioning in re\u00ad\ngard to typical autism interventions, but require more \nassistance and guidance than those children with classic \nlearning disabilities. Children with Asperger\u2019s syndrome \ncan demonstrate average or above-average intellectual \nfunctioning, yet experience continued social struggles \nwith adults and peers.\n350\t\nChapter 24\u2003 Cognition and Mental Health\n", "Figure 24-4\u2002 Inability to relate is a category of characteristics of autism.\n\u00a9 wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock\nAttention-Deficit Disorder\nAttention-deficit disorder (ADD) and attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are conditions in which \na child displays three classic behaviors: impulsivity, inat\u00ad\ntentiveness, and hyperactivity. Typically diagnosed in the \nschool-age period, the child with ADD/ADHD experi\u00ad\nences struggles with learning, memorizing, behavioral \nchallenges of attention, and social expectations for age. \nThese disorders are considered developmentally inap\u00ad\npropriate patterns of behavior in which symptoms appear \nbefore the seventh birthday and are present between the \nages of 4 and 18 years. The child with ADD/ADHD also \ndisplays symptoms in more than one setting.\nThe prevalence of ADD/ADHD has been variously esti\u00ad\nmated to be 2.3 to 6 times higher in males than in females \n(DuPaul & Stoner, 2014; Ramtekkar, Reiersen, Todorov, \n& Todd, 2010). An estimated 11% of U.S. school-age \nchildren have received this diagnosis (CDC, 2016c). It is \nmost commonly identified in the classroom by teachers \n(DuPaul & Stoner, 2014). The child\u2019s intelligence can be \nat or above average, yet the child struggles in completing \ntasks, studying, and staying quiet when expected. A cycle \nof behavior followed by negative reactions from peers and \nadults, followed by maladaptive behaviors, is common. \nSelf-esteem and self-image can be affected, causing the \nchild distress.\nPhysiologically, the child with ADD/ADHD may \ndisplay abnormal levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, or \ndopamine. In some cases, there may be an alteration in the \nchild\u2019s reticular activating system within the midbrain. With \nother children, ADD/ADHD is associated with an abusive \nhome, a chaotic home, or a history of parental substance \nabuse, depression, or antisocial disorders.\nClassic symptoms of ADD and ADHD include the \nfollowing manifestations:\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nCauses of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health \n(2015b), a diagnosis of ADHD in children may be related to \nvarious nongenetic factors:\n\u2022\t Exposure to artificial food coloring substances and food \ndye additives, which make the severity of ADHD more \nprofound (Arnold, Lofthouse, & Hurt, 2012; Aungst, n.d.)\n\u2022\t Very low birth weight\n\u2022\t Complications associated with ischemic-hypoxic \nepisodes during the birthing process\n\u2022\t Smoking during pregnancy\n\u2022\t Drinking during pregnancy\n\u2022\t Exposure to toxic substance such as lead\n\u2022\t Child maltreatment, including extreme neglect and \nchild abuse\n\u2022\t Social deprivation\n\u2022\t Inattention to details in the classroom, when study\u00ad\ning, and in other environments where instructions \nare given and performance expectations are \npresent; avoids or dislikes activities where the \nchild must demonstrate sustained mental effort\n\u2022\t Poor listening skills, inability to follow important \ninstructions, ineffective work habits leading to lack \nof completion and losing academic assignments, \npaperwork, and other items needed for school; \ntypically cannot wait for his or her turn in group \nsituations\n\u2022\t Fidgety behaviors, difficulty in sitting, impulsivity, \nand increased motor function displayed in most \nsituations\n\u2022\t Seems to be busy at all times and does not engage \nin quiet play\n\u2022\t Communicates poorly with excessive talking, \ninappropriate conversations, and interruptions; \nblurts out answers before being asked to provide \none when questioned\n\u2022\t Physical complaints associated with decreased \nappetite and insomnia\nTreatment for ADD/ADHD includes two approaches: \nMedications may be ordered to assist the child with im\u00ad\nproved attention, and behavioral modification may be \nprovided through parental and teacher education and \nsupport. The medications used to treat attention disor\u00ad\nders have side effects, so the decision to place a child on \npharmacologic interventions should not be made lightly. \nTable 24-4 identifies medications currently prescribed for \nADD/ADHD, along with their trade names, mechanism \nof action, and side effects.\n\t\nMental Health Issues in Children\t\n351\n", "as being very \u201cup,\u201d with high energy, talkativeness, and ac\u00ad\ntive behaviors (manic episode), as well as by the opposite \nstate, in which the child is \u201clow\u201d and displays behaviors \nof classic depression with low energy, social withdrawal, \nand sadness (depressive episode). The swings of emotion \ncome with a wide variety of temporal factors. Each side \nof the mood swings can last for hours, days, weeks, or \nmonths. The extreme swings of \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d can be \naccompanied with short or long periods of \u201cnormal\u201d or \nexpected behaviors found in children without the disorder, \nor behaviors can be described as \u201cmixed.\u201d The diagnosis of \nbipolar disorder is not representative of normal childhood \nmood swings; rather, it is a serious psychiatric disorder \ncharacterized by extremes in behaviors.\nOther symptoms of bipolar disorder include changes in \neating, sleeping, playing, and interacting with others. When \nin the manic phase, children can have a short temper, be \nvery silly, or display unusual moods for their age. They have \ntrouble focusing at home and at school, and may engage in \na higher level and frequency of high-risk behaviors.

The most successful management of schizo\u00ad\nphrenia is achieved through a \u201ccoordinated specialty care\u201d \nmanagement program that integrates medications, educa\u00ad\ntion, therapy, family involvement, and academic or employ\u00ad\nment assistance through a multidisciplinary coordinated \neffort. Young people benefit highly from having a coordi\u00ad\nnated and sustained program to reduce what can be a very \nsignificant long-term mental disability (NIMH, 2016c).\nEating Disorders\nEating disorders cover both severe underweight and \nsevere overweight, as well as abnormal eating behaviors. \nThe incidence of eating disorders continues to rise in the \nUnited States (Wade, Keski-Rahkonen, & Hudson, 2011). \nAlthough females have a higher rate of eating disorders \nthan males, the incidence in males is also increasing. \nCurrently, the prevalence rate for obesity is 16.9% among \nchildren between 2 and 19 years of age (Ogden, Carroll, \nKit, & Flegal, 2014).

This highly disabling disorder appears \nas though the person afflicted does not live in reality or has \nlost touch with reality. Cases in children are usually not \nconfirmed until the child is 16 years or older. Only rarely \ndo young children display the symptoms of this disorder.\nSchizophrenia affects three main areas of cognitive and \nbehavioral functioning. First, a child may display \u201ccognitive \nsymptoms,\u201d such as difficulty processing information, remem\u00ad\nbering, making decisions, and paying attention. Second, a \nchild may have \u201cpositive symptoms\u201d\u2014that is, overt alterations \nin mentation, including delusional thinking, hallucinations, \ndysfunctional thought processing, and agitated movements \nof the body (Figure 24-5). Third, a child may have \u201cnega\u00ad\ntive symptoms,\u201d in which emotional and mental processes \nare greatly subdued, as indicated by a flat affect, reduced \ncommunication, and reduced pleasure in everyday life.\nNo exact etiology of schizophrenia in children has been \nidentified, but research supports a relationship between \ngenes, the child\u2019s environment, malnutrition, viral exposure, \nand several psychosocial factors. An imbalance of gluta\u00ad\nmate, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters may play a \nrole in the development of this disorder, especially during \npuberty (NIMH, 2016c). Some evidence suggests a link \nbetween cannabis use and development of schizophrenia \n\t\nMental Health Issues in Children\t\n353\n", "nondigestible household and environmental substances \nsuch as dirt, pebbles, and sand. Pica has been associ\u00ad\nated with anemia, autism, and developmental delay.

The development of an intestinal blockage \nis considered a health emergency.\nTreatment for Eating Disorders\nThe physiological consequences of eating disorders in \nchildren require attention by an interdisciplinary pediatric \nhealthcare team. Nurses, physicians, child psychologists, \npharmacists, family members, and teachers need to be \ninvolved in the early identification of the disorder and \nits treatment and management. A significant number of \nchildren\u2014mostly teen girls\u2014die each year in the United \nStates due to the physiological consequences of extreme \ndietary restriction, purging, vomiting, and self-abuse. \nEstimating the true mortality rate is difficult, however, be\u00ad\ncause a frequent cause of death (up to 25% in one study) in \nthose with eating disorders is suicide (Franko et\u00a0al., 2013). \nBox 24-2 identifies moderately severe and life-threatening \nconsequences of eating disorders.\nincidence of 3.8% of females and 1.5% of males (Merikan\u00ad\ngas et\u00a0al., 2010; NIMH, 2016a).

Table 24-5 differentiates the features of \ntwo types of restrictive eating disorders\u2014namely, bulimia \nand anorexia nervosa. Risk factors for the development of \nan eating disorder during the developmental period include \ndepression, family predisposition (e.g., mother is anorexic), \nmiddle to upper socioeconomic class, dysfunctional family, \nexcessive self-expectations, obsessive\u2012compulsive behaviors, \nand sexual abuse.\nPica\nAnother eating disorder found across the developmental \nperiod is pica, or the consumption of material not associ\u00ad\nated with food substances.

Mental health and cognitive processing are also \nintertwined with the child\u2019s thinking about the world \nand the meaning of his or her existence.\n\u25c6\u25c6Cognitive impairment denotes a variety of unusually \nlow states of mental processing. Risk factors associated \nwith the development of cognitive impairment include \nbrain trauma, microcephaly, metabolic disorders, chronic \nlead exposure, congenital rubella or syphilis, and fetal \nalcohol syndrome.\n\u25c6\u25c6The incidence of mental health issues, concerns, and \ndiagnoses is increasing both in the United States and \nworldwide. Children can present with depression, \nanxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other \npsychiatric concerns. Pediatric nurses play an integral \nrole in the early identification, referral, assessment, and \ntreatment and management of children with mental \nhealth issues.\n\u25c6\u25c6Depression is a mental health disorder that, for some \nchildren, profoundly impacts their ability to function \non a daily basis.\n\u25c6\u25c6Treatment of depression in children includes three \naspects: (1) a mental health counselor or therapist to \nhelp children determine the causes of their feelings \nof\u00a0hopelessness, unhappiness, and possible loneliness; \n(2) positive coping strategies to deal with these stressors; \nand (3) medications and family support.\n\u25c6\u25c6Attention-deficit disorder and attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder are conditions diagnosed during \nthe school-age period where a child displays three classic \nbehaviors: impulsivity, inattentiveness, and hyperactiv\u00ad\nity. The child with ADD/ADHD experiences struggles \nwith learning, memorization, behavioral challenges of \nattention, and social expectations for age.\n\u25c6\u25c6Other mental health conditions the pediatric nurse may \nencounter in children include autism, schizophrenia, \nbipolar disorder, and eating disorders.\nBibliography\nAbma, J.

This system is called adap\u00ad\ntive because, unlike the components of the innate immune \nsystem, the cells of the adaptive immune system (such as T \nand B lymphocytes) change in response to exposures so that \nthey can respond more rapidly and aggressively to a repeat \nexposure. Thus, once exposed to various disease-causing \npathogens through either infection or vaccination, the \nchild is subsequently less susceptible to infection by that \npathogen. The adaptive immune system is the \u201cmemory\u201d \nof immunity (Figure 25-1).\nAcquired Versus Natural Adaptive \nImmunity\nAdaptive immunity comes in four intersecting types: \nnatural (immunity developed through contact with an \nagent in the environment) and acquired (immunity \nthat is not inherited), and active (immunity developed \nthrough contact with a disease-causing agent) and passive \n(immunity developed through exposure to antibodies, \nsuch as through breast milk).\n\u2022\t Natural active immunity occurs when a child comes \ninto contact with an agent that has the potential to \ncause disease but was not deliberately introduced. \nThe encounter with the antigen may or may not \nresult in a symptomatic response\u2014for example, \nrelease of histamine, inflammation, or fever\u2014but in \neither instance it results in the creation of memory \nIntroduction\nThe concept of immunity refers to the ability of the human \nbody to defend against organisms and antigens that cause \ndisease or toxicity. A child\u2019s immunity status determines \nthe\u00a0child\u2019s ability to fight against childhood infectious \ndisease as well as the child\u2019s susceptibility to routinely \nencountered allergens such as pollen, dust, and other \nsubstances. Because children are progressively exposed \nto infectious organisms in their environment, they are at \nrisk for developing diseases from these pathogenic sources. \nThe administration of childhood immunizations is encour\u00ad\naged to prevent a child from developing certain infectious \ndiseases that range from relatively mild (i.e., chickenpox) \nto severe enough to be potentially life threatening.\nImmune System Function\nThe human body has the capability to identify and elimi\u00ad\nnate foreign substances, particularly microorganisms that \nenter the body and cause infection there. The immune \nsystem includes both specific and nonspecific components, \nincluding barriers, eliminators, and antigenic specificity. \nThe most obvious immune barrier is the skin, but muco\u00ad\nsal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, inner ears, \nand urogenital tract also offer protection against invaders \n(Dwivedy & Aich, 2011). Innate immunity consists of \ncells and proteins\u2014such as macrophages, neutrophils, \nand natural killer cells\u2014that are programmed to quickly \nidentify and react to the invasion of microorganisms. \nAdaptive immunity refers to components of the lymph \nFigure 25-1\u2002 Immune cells and their functions.\nNeutrophil\nEosinophil\nPlatelets\nRed blood\ncells\nMonocyte\nDendritic cell\nMacrophage\nBasophil\nHematopoietic\nstem cell\nMultipotent\nstem cell\nMyeloid\nprogenitor cell\nLymphoid\nprogenitor cell\nB lymphocyte\nPlasma cell\nT lymphocytes\nNatural killer\n(NK) cell\nBone\nmarrow\n360\t\nChapter 25\u2003 Immune System Disorders\n", "T cells, which allow the immune system to recog\u00ad\nnize that antigen at a later date.\n\u2022\t Acquired active immunity, also called nonspecific \nimmunity, develops when a child is deliberately ex\u00ad\nposed to an antigen via a vaccine or immunization \nintended to produce memory T cells without caus\u00ad\ning disease.\n\u2022\t Natural passive immunity develops from the pas\u00ad\nsage of maternal antibodies across the placenta \nfrom mother to the fetus, or during breastfeeding.\n\u2022\t Artificial or intentional passive immunity is de\u00ad\nrived from actively administering antibodies to a \nnon-immune child, such as via plasma with pooled \nantibodies called intravenous immunoglobulins \n(IVIG) or intramuscular injections (IM) or by \nmonoclonal antibodies (mAb).\nImmune System Malfunctions\nThere are a number of circumstances in which the im\u00ad\nmune system may function incorrectly or inadequately. \nImmune deficiency disorders represent situations in \nwhich the appropriate types or amounts of immune \ncells are not present, are present in insufficient amounts \nto perform their function, or are altered in some way \nsuch that they cannot function properly. These disorders \ninclude primary immunodeficiency diseases such as \nchronic granulomatous disease, which results in defec\u00ad\ntive monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils (making \nthe child susceptible to Staphylococcus and fungal infec\u00ad\ntions), and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), \nin which both T and B cells are absent, leaving the child \nvulnerable to any form of microbial infection (Delves, \nMartin, Burton, & Roitt, 2011). Immune deficiency may \nalso be acquired via infectious diseases, of which human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) is among the best known, \nor it may develop due to blood cancers (leukemia) that \ncause immature, nonfunctional lymphocytes to prolifer\u00ad\nate at the expense of normal cells. In these situations, the \nchild develops impaired immunocompetence\u2014that is, he \nor she is left with reduced ability to fight off infections \nso that even minor microbial encounters can become \nextremely serious.\nIn contrast to deficiency disorders, in which immune \nsystem function is inadequate, other immune disorders \nmay develop in which the immune system either overreacts \nagainst a genuine foreign body (hyper-responsiveness or \nhyper-reactivity response, also known as allergy), or else \nreacts against a \u201cself\u201d antigen on normal body tissues that \nit is supposed to ignore (autoimmune response) (Delves \net\u00a0al., 2011). Allergy can range in severity from annoy\u00ad\ning\u2014sneezing and runny nose in response to spring pollen, \nfor example\u2014to life-threatening anaphylactic reactions \nto foods, chemicals, or insect venom. A hyper-reactive \nimmune system may overreact only to very specific \ntriggers, such as animal dander or a particular species \nof pollen, or a child may have multiple allergies. Autoim\u00ad\nmune response may target particular tissues, as in type 1 \n(autoimmune) diabetes or Graves\u2019s thyroiditis, or it may \ncause system-wide immune attacks on normal tissues, as \nin systemic lupus erythematosus. In autoimmune disease, \nthe immune system usually responds appropriately in \nthe presence of infectious agents, but its effects on body \ntissues can range from progressively debilitating (as in \nrheumatoid arthritis) to acutely life-threatening (as in \ntype 1 diabetes).\nAssessments of the Immune System\nThere are limited means to assess the immune system. \nLaboratory values provide the most consistent and ac\u00ad\ncurate information about a child\u2019s ability to fight infec\u00ad\ntion. Specific symptoms associated with immune system \ndysfunction or immune pathologies can assist in making \na definitive diagnosis in case of immune-related disorders. \nThe following laboratory assessments are used to determine \nimmune function, status, and disease (UCLA Pathology \nand Laboratory Medicine, 2015):\n\u2022\t Complete blood cell counts with white blood cell \ndifferentiation (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, \nmegakaryocytes) (Figure 25-2)\n\u2022\t Quantification of global cell-mediated immunity\n\u2022\t Lymphocytes (CD4 T-helper cells)\nFigure 25-2\u2002 A complete blood cell count is one of the laboratory \nassessments that can help determine immune function, status, and \ndisease.\n\u00a9 JSABBOTT/E+/Getty Images\n\t\nAssessments of the Immune System\t\n361\n", "and environmental allergens can all potentially trigger a \nsystemic allergic reaction in highly susceptible children. In \nmost cases, avoidance of the allergen, once it is identified, \nis the best way to prevent reactions.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of systemic allergic reactions can be made \nby visual inspection. The child may present with itching, \nflushing, hives, stridor, wheezing, dyspnea, nausea, ab\u00ad\ndominal pain, dizziness, hypotension, and finally shock \n(Box 25-1; Figure 25-3).\nRisk Factors\nKnowing and communicating a child\u2019s risk factors to all \nadults involved with a child\u2019s care is imperative. Risk fac\u00ad\ntors include medical history, family history, concurrent \nasthma or atopy, and elevated allergen-specific IgE levels.\nMedical Treatment\nRapid medical treatment for systemic allergic reactions is \nbased on the progression of the condition and prevention \nof shock. The child should be managed by an experienced \ncode blue or rapid response team, and should be transferred \nto a pediatric intensive care environment for observation. \n\u2022\t Immunoglobulin identification and levels (IgM, \nIgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD)\n\u2022\t Biomarkers of immune reactivity\n\u2022\t Flow cytometry immunophenotyping\n\u2022\t DNA or RNA assays to particular pathogens such \nas HIV\n\u2022\t Sequential analysis using assays that measure dis\u00ad\ntinct immune functions\nImmunity Concept Exemplars\nThis section outlines three exemplars for the concept of \nimmunity. Understanding the concept as it relates to the \ngeneral principles of immunity, immune response, autoim\u00ad\nmunity, and nursing provides a foundation for care.\nSystemic Allergic Reactions\nWhen a child is exposed to an allergen, IgE antibodies are \nquickly synthesized and attach themselves to the cell walls of \nmast cells and basophils.

Education and reinforcement of an \nemergency plan with available, unexpired medications is \nthe most important component of the nursing care.\nIdiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nAlso known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, id\u00ad\niopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired \nimmune deficiency disorder in which a child presents \nwith easy or excessive bleeding and bruising due to low \ncirculating platelets. A normal platelet count for children \nis between 150,000 to 300,000; however, children with ITP \nhave platelet counts less than 100,000. This condition is \ncaused by an autoimmune response in which antibodies are \nproduced against the child\u2019s own platelets. Consequently, \nthe child cannot produce clots sufficient to stop bleeding \nepisodes. In children, ITP is associated with recovery from \na viral illness; in such a case, the child will usually fully \nrecover from ITP. If a child\u2019s platelet count falls danger\u00ad\nously low, the child is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage \nand other serious consequences.\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis of ITP is made by identifying the symptoms \nof bleeding into the skin (petechial rash), easy bruising, \nnosebleeds, or bleeding from the mouth (Figure 25-5). \nLaboratory evaluation of the child\u2019s platelets will demon\u00ad\nstrate a low count, but a bone marrow aspiration or biopsy \nmay be required in clinical situations where the child\u2019s \ncondition is not improving on its own.\nRisk Factors\nThe only known risk factor is a viral infection prior to the \npresentation of low platelets. This condition is not common \nand cannot be prevented or identified via genetic testing.\nAdministration of the following medications complements \na team effort for resuscitation and vascular support:\n\u2022\t Epinephrine\n\u2022\t Rapid-acting bronchodilator such as albuterol\n\u2022\t Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)\n\u2022\t Systemic corticosteroid anti-inflammatory agent \n(Solu-Medrol)\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nPreparing for Anaphylaxis\nPediatric nurses who knowingly administer a medication that \nhas the potential to cause a severe allergic reaction should be \nprepared to respond quickly if the patient develops anaphylaxis. \nHaving access to a code cart and the following medications \nand supplies is imperative:\n\u2022\t Epinephrine\n\u2022\t Antihistamine\n\u2022\t Steroid anti-inflammatory agent\n\u2022\t Intravenous fluid boluses\n\u2022\t Oxygen\nNursing Care\nChildren who are at risk for or who have a confirmed experi\u00ad\nence with systemic allergic reactions should wear medical \nalert jewelry, should have an EpiPen (Figure 25-4) available \nat all times, should know what their triggers are, and should \nhave an emergency action plan that the child, family, school, \ncaregivers, and coaches understand and feel confident in \nimplementing.

JRA occurs more often in female \nchildren than in male children.\nMedical Treatment\nTreatment for JRA focuses on managing symptoms such \nas pain, swelling, and stiffness, and on preventing exacer\u00ad\nbations. There is no cure for JRA/JIA. The care for a child \nwith JRA/JIA should be a coordinated effort and include \nrheumatologists, physical and occupational therapists, and \npediatric nursing care. Medications used as treatments \ninclude the following:\n\u2022\t Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as \nfirst-line treatment.\n\u2022\t Steroids for children with moderate or severe \narthritis or nonarthritic inflammatory conse\u00ad\nquences of JRA. The lowest possible dosing is pri\u00ad\noritized due to the severe side effects of steroids.\n\u2022\t Antirheumatic medications such as cyclosporine \n(Sandimmune), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), metho\u00ad\ntrexate (gold standard), and azathioprine (Imuran). \nThe greatest risk identified with antirheumatics is \nimmune suppression, which is accompanied by \nincreased risk for infections. Tumor necrosis factor \nalpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors are also used to treat \nJRA/JIA.\n\u2022\t Autologous stem cell transplantation is reserved for \nchildren with JRA for whom all other treatment op\u00ad\ntions have failed.\nNursing Care\nNursing care for children with JRA/JIA encompasses \nboth prevention and support. It includes education on \nadherence to medicines, follow-up appointments, therapy, \nhome care, and, as the child grows, self-care. Children and \ntheir families will need support, as emotional distress over \nJRA\u2019s tendency to cause significant pain and disabilities \ncan occur. Clinically significant pain, even with medical \nMedical Treatment\nA child\u2019s condition may warrant medical treatment. Steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment. If the \nplatelet count does not improve with this therapy, the child \nmay need to be given intravenous infusions of high-dose \ngamma-globulins, danazol (oral), or other drugs that suppress \nthe immune system\u2019s production of antiplatelet antibodies.\nNursing Care\nSafety is paramount to the care of a child with ITP. The \nchild should be placed on bleeding precautions, and the \nfamily must be taught how to minimize the chances of \nbleeding. Discuss how to keep the child quiet and engaged \nin nonharmful activities. Teach the family the importance \nof the medication regimen and when to report worsening \nconditions.\nJuvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis and \nJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\nAs their names imply, both forms of juvenile arthritis affect \nchildren younger than the age of 16. Juvenile rheumatoid \narthritis (JRA) is an autoimmune condition in which the \nchild\u2019s immune system attacks the cells surrounding the \nsynovial membranes of the joints, causing persistent and \npainful joint injury, swelling, stiffness, and decreased range \nof motion. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is slightly dif\u00ad\nferent: It is an \u201cautoinflammatory\u201d condition in which the \ncells responsible for the normal inflammatory response are \ntriggered by encounters with the body\u2019s \u201cself\u201d antigens. In \nthis case, inflammation arises but the tissues of the body \nare not actually destroyed (National Institute of Arthritis \nand Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [NIAMSD], 2015). \nNevertheless, the symptoms of pain, swelling, and stiff\u00ad\nness are very similar, and the only distinguishing factor \nis whether autoantibodies are present (they are present in \nJRA, and absent in JIA).\nSome children diagnosed with JRA or JIA have continual \nsymptoms lasting only a few months, while others have exacer\u00ad\nbations that last an entire lifetime. The location of the joints \nand the number of joints affected vary per child. For some \nchildren with JRA/JIA, systemic symptoms occur, including \nsignificant skin rashes, high fever spikes, uveitis or iritis, and \nlymphadenopathy. Both environmental factors and viral \nexposures may trigger an exacerbation (NIAMSD, 2015).\nDiagnosis\nThe American College of Rheumatology (2010) encourages \nthe use of the following criteria to diagnose JRA:\n1.\t Morning stiffness, joint pain\n2.\t Swelling or fluid around three or more joints si\u00ad\nmultaneously, with at least one being in the fingers, \nwrist, or hand area\n364\t\nChapter 25\u2003 Immune System Disorders\n", "viral material as the T cell replicates. This process, called \nreverse transcription, results in the gradual suppression \nof cell-mediated immunity, causing the lymph organs to \nbecome infected. The child\u2019s immune system function is \naltered, leaving the child susceptible to infections.\nHIV and AIDS may be transmitted to children via the \nfollowing routes:\n\u2022\t Infants: Transmission from an infected mother, \neither in utero or via breastfeeding\n\u2022\t Adolescents: Unprotected sex with an infected \nsexual partner or injection drug use\n\u2022\t Any age: Transfusion of HIV-infected blood \nproducts when product screening is inadequate\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of AIDS requires an extremely low total \nCD4 cell count (Table 25-2) and the development of an \nAIDS-defining illness such as the following conditions:\n\u2022\t Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis\n\u2022\t Recurrent bacterial infections\n\u2022\t Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n\u2022\t Cryptosporidiosis\n\u2022\t Herpes simplex virus\n\u2022\t Severe yeast infections, especially in the esophageal \nor pulmonary tissues\n\u2022\t Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex \ninfection\n\u2022\t Cytomegalovirus infections\n\u2022\t Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma\nMedical Treatment\nHighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) remains \nthe gold-standard treatment for HIV-positive children. \ntreatment, can influence the child\u2019s functioning, social \nlife, emotional health, and role functions (Stinson & Luca, \n2012). Teaching families to supplement medical treatment \nwith nonpharmacologic interventions has been shown to \ndecrease symptoms. Research has shown warm baths and \ncompresses before school, gentle daily range-of-motion \nexercises, swimming, low- and high-intensity exercises, \nsplinting and orthoses, sleep hygiene, and Internet sup\u00ad\nport interventions to be effective palliative treatments \n(Stinson & Luca, 2012). Nursing care must focus on pre\u00ad\nventing complications of JRA/JIA, including significant \njoint damage with deformity, osteoporosis, emotional \ndistress, and growth abnormalities. Opioid therapy \nmay be required for children with refractory joint pain \n(Connelly & Schanberg, 2008).\nPHARMACOLOGY\nTreatment for Juvenile Rheumatoid \nArthritis: Methotrexate\nMany children with JRA affecting several joints will be \nplaced on oral methotrexate, a type of antineoplastic \nused in many childhood cancer treatment protocols. \nMethotrexate works by depleting the folinic acid from \ndividing cells. In small doses, the drug will suppress the \nchild\u2019s immune system to decrease or prevent autoim\u00ad\nmune joint erosion. The child will be on six days of oral \nmethotrexate, followed by a day of oral folinic (vitamin B) \nsupplements. Adherence to this \u201crescue\u201d dose is impera\u00ad\ntive. The pediatric nurse must reinforce family teaching \non these medications.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nI\nn a study by Cespedes-Cruz et\u00a0al. (2008), 521 children with \nJRA were treated with methotrexate. The researchers\u2019 find\u00ad\nings showed that over the course of 6 months, the children \nreported dramatic reductions in pain, and increased physical \nactivity and function.\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus and \nAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the viral \norganism that causes acquired immunodeficiency syn\u00ad\ndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted by direct contact with \nan infected person\u2019s body fluids, secretions, or blood. The \nvirus enters the body and binds to the CD4 receptor located \non the cell membrane of the T-lymphocyte cell. The viral \nDNA attaches to the T cell\u2019s DNA and reproduces new \nTABLE 25-2\u2003\nHIV Stages of Infection\nAcute retroviral syndrome: Develops within a few days of \ninfection or a few weeks.

The most frequently \nseen illness in childhood is the common cold, which can \nbe caused by any one of a variety of viruses (Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016a). A com\u00ad\nmon reason for hospitalization of infants is the severity of \nclinical presentation and complications associated with \nrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which may lead \nto significant bronchiolitis requiring clinical support. Young \nchildren and infants are prone to contracting infections due \nto their immature immune systems (Table 26-1). Children \nentering childcare facilities and school environments be\u00ad\ncome rapidly exposed to infectious materials due to their \nincreased socialization in this setting and their encounters \nwith other children who may be under-immunized or \ninfected due to older siblings\u2019 exposure. Pediatric nurses \nwill undoubtedly find themselves caring for and treating \nchildren with an abundance of infectious diseases. For \nthe purpose of this chapter, the terms \u201ccommunicable \ndiseases\u201d and \u201cinfectious diseases of childhood\u201d will be \nused interchangeably to describe these illnesses.\nAlthough childhood infectious diseases are associated \nwith microbial pathogens, not all microbes cause childhood \nillness. Sometimes the germ causes illness, but at other \ntimes it is the process of intoxication, or exposure to the \npathogen\u2019s toxins, that causes disease.\nThe bacteria that make up the normal flora on a child\u2019s \nskin do not cause the child to experience an infection \n(i.e., invasion by microorganisms, which then reproduce \nin the body) unless there is a breach in skin integrity and \nthe conditions are right for the microbe to flourish.

This viral infection can infect the \ntestes and the pancreas as well.\n\u203a\u203a\nNorovirus: Causes rapid-onset acute diarrhea. The viral infection is highly contagious and can be acquired through touching \ncontaminated surfaces, water, or food.\n\u203a\u203a\nPertussis: Also called whooping cough. The bacterium Bordetella pertussis causes a highly contagious, acute lung infection \nthat leads to severe episodes of coughing and requires antibiotic therapy (CDC, 2015c).\n\u203a\u203a\nPneumonia: An acute lung inflammation, congestion, and consolidation. Infections can be caused by a variety of viruses, \nbacteria, and fungi, and are associated with fever, cough, and dyspnea.\n\u203a\u203a\nRespiratory syncytial virus: Cause of acute lung infections leading to bronchiolitis.

Immunization schedules are updated \nregularly and are based on the needs of a population. In the \nUnited States, immunization schedules are recommended \nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which \nprovides specific guidelines for healthcare providers across \nsettings who provide vaccinations (i.e., administration \nof weakened or dead pathogens; the vaccine is intended \nto provoke the production of antibodies that confer im\u00ad\nmunity against the full-blown disease) to patients across \nthe developmental period (CDC, 2015a) (Table 26-3). If \na child experiences a medical condition or a life circum\u00ad\nstance (e.g., travel or immigration) that leads to a delay \nor incomplete participation in the usual immunization \nschedule, \u201ccatch-up\u201d and alternative schedules are avail\u00ad\nable that can be used to determine best practices for the \nindividual child. Children who are partially immunized \nor do not start immunizations until later in childhood for \nother reasons should also follow alternative schedules; \nthese schedules may be found on the CDC and National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) websites.\nFamilies must be taught to maintain accurate records \nso that children entering school have the immunization \ndocumentation required for enrollment. Some states \nhave also passed laws preventing children from attending \nprivate and public schools if immunization schedules are \nnot complete according to the child\u2019s age.\nFamily education is needed concerning the circumstances \nin which a child cannot be administered a vaccine. Minor \nillnesses are typically not a reason to withhold administration. \nIf a required and scheduled vaccine is not administered, the \nnext appointment should be made and the family should \nreceive clear guidelines on the importance of keeping the \nchild\u2019s immunization on track.\nrespiratory secretions) are the most important areas in \nwhich to provide preventive education.\nAncillary healthcare providers and childcare providers \nmust understand the basic clinical presentation of com\u00ad\nmon childhood infections. Early identification of urinary \ntract infections, respiratory tract infections, communicable \nskins lesions, otitis media, gastrointestinal infections, and \nother common childhood infections will assist in rapid \nclinical management and prevention of disease transmis\u00ad\nsion. For instance, bacterial urinary tract infections are \nvery common in diapered infants and young children, as \nwell as in toddlers who are being potty trained (Box 26-1). \nIdentification of early signs and symptoms of this infection \nacross these developmental periods should elicit rapid \nassessments, early treatment, and prevention of possible \nlonger-term complications.\n\u0007BOX 26-1\u2002 \u0007Common Bacterial Strains Causing Urinary Tract \nInfections\n\u2022\t Escherichia coli from the intestines; children wiping \nfrom back to front\n\u2022\t Staphylococcus saprophyticus\n\u2022\t Klebsiella\n\u2022\t Enterococcus\n\u2022\t Proteus mirabilis\nFigure 26-2\u2002 The small risk of side effects associated with a vaccine \noutweighs the risk of the child developing a disease that might poten\u00ad\ntially cause serious illness or death. \n\u00a9 Ariel Skelley/Blend Images/Getty Images\nChildhood Immunizations\nAs a child grows and develops, he or she is exposed to more \nand more environments that inherently have germs and \npotential pathogens. When a germ enters a child\u2019s body, \nthe immune system will recognize it as a foreign substance \nknown as an antigen. The child\u2019s immune system launches \na fight against antigens by producing massive quantities \nof antibodies. When a child is given a vaccine, the dead \nor weakened antigen triggers the production of antibod\u00ad\nies that provide protection to the child if he or she is ever \nagain exposed to that particular communicable disease \nor pathogen. A vaccine does not and cannot produce the \ndisease itself; instead, it stimulates the child\u2019s immune sys\u00ad\ntem to create disease-fighting antibodies. The small risk of \nside effects associated with a vaccine outweighs the risk of \nthe child developing a disease that might potentially cause \nserious illness or death (Figure 26-2). Mild side effects can \noccur with administration of vaccines, such as tenderness \nat the injection site, soreness, fever, and fussiness; serious \nside effects are very rare. Children with chronic illnesses, \nwith certain forms of childhood cancer, or who are taking \nimmunosuppressive drugs may not be able to tolerate vac\u00ad\ncines for a period of time, and sometimes forever.\nCompliance with timely and complete childhood immuni\u00ad\nzation schedules has been credited with the near-elimination \n372\t\nChapter 26\u2003 Infection and Communicable Diseases in Childhood\n", "Data from Pediat\nTABLE 26-3\u2003\nRecommended Childhood Immunizations\nDTaP Vaccine (All bacteria; diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis)\n\u203a\u203a\nAdministered intramuscularly (IM)\n\u203a\u203a\nMaximal effects occur if the immunization is administered with a time lapse of 8 weeks between doses\n\u203a\u203a\nAcetaminophen can be administered at 4 and 8 hours after the injection to decrease local responses and febrile incidents\n\u203a\u203a\nTdap is recommended to be administered to children older than 7 years of age; DTaP is recommended for children younger \nthan 7 years\nMeasles Vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nAdministered subcutaneously (SQ)\n\u203a\u203a\nFirst dose is given between 12 and 16 months of age; second dose is given between 4 and 6 years of age\n\u203a\u203a\nPost-immunization mild reactions include transient rashes and fever up to two weeks after the injection\nMumps Vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nAdministered SQ\n\u203a\u203a\nGiven in combination with measles and rubella at 12\u201316 months of age\n\u203a\u203a\nA second dose is definitely required based on the number of mumps cases that have occurred in recent years\nRubella Vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nAdministered SQ\n\u203a\u203a\nImportant to immunize postpubertal children\n\u203a\u203a\nPregnancy should be avoided within 3 months of the vaccine\u2019s administration due to a theoretical risk to the fetus\nPolio Vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nAdministered IM or SQ\n\u203a\u203a\nCDC recommends exclusive use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and not oral polio vaccine (OPV); live organisms from OPV \nare shed in stool for up to 1 month\nHepatitis B Vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nAdministered IM\n\u203a\u203a\nInfants born to mothers who test negative for hepatitis B surface antigen should follow the routine immunization \nschedule\n\u203a\u203a\nInfants born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen should follow the alternative immunization \nschedule, which includes vaccine within 12 hours of birth and hepatitis B immunoglobulin infusion; contact the CDC for \nmore information\n\u203a\u203a\nFirst dose is given during the neonatal period up to 2 months of age; the second dose is given 1\u20132 months later; the third \ndose is given at 6 months of age\nPneumococcal Vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nThere are two types: PCV7/Prevnar (administered IM) and PPV/Pneumovax (administered IM or SQ)\n\u203a\u203a\nPPV is recommended for children 2\u20135 years old with high risks, such as sickle cell disease, HIV, asplenia, nephrotic syndrome, \nand other immunosuppressive disorders\nVaricella Vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nAdministered SQ\n\u203a\u203a\nConsidered live, attenuated viral vaccine\n\u203a\u203a\nApproved for children older than 12 months of age\n\u203a\u203a\nFirst dose is given at 12\u201316 months of age; second dose is given at 4\u20136 years of age or at least 3 months after the first dose\nData from Pediatric Primary Care retrieved from http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.10.0b/ovidweb.cgi?targetFrame=1&S=MLPIFPCKDPDD (2013) on December 1st, 2014\n\t\nChildhood Immunizations\t\n373\n", "information handy.

In some areas with low childhood immunization \nrates, some parents have a false sense of security about their \nchildren\u2019s health, based on the erroneous belief that their \nunimmunized or under-immunized child will be protected \nthrough the concept known as \u201cherd immunity,\u201d \u201cherd protec\u00ad\ntion,\u201d or \u201csocial/population immunity.\u201d This concept relates \nto a form of indirect protection from infectious diseases \nthat arises because a large percentage of a given popula\u00ad\ntion has been vaccinated against a particular infection. \nThus, there is little likelihood of a disease outbreak, which \nin turn protects those who were not vaccinated. This idea \ncreates a false sense of security and puts children at risk if \nan exposure occurs.\nBEST PRACTICES\nVaccine Administration Considerations\n\u2022\t Ensure strict adherence to the vaccine manufacturer\u2019s \nhandling, storage, and administration recommenda\u00ad\ntions. Do not allow the vaccine\u2019s potency to diminish.\n\u2022\t Make sure all healthcare professionals who are admin\u00ad\nistering childhood vaccines are immunized to mea\u00ad\nsles, mumps, hepatitis B, influenza, rubella, pertussis, \ntetanus, polio, and diphtheria.\n\u2022\t Use sterile, disposable needles with safety devices \non the syringes to prevent needle sticks; never recap \nneedles; and keep a red biohazard container for sy\u00ad\nringe disposal within reach.\n\u2022\t Wear gloves when giving immunizations to children, \nas they may be challenging to hold, which increases \nthe risk for body fluid exposure.\n\u2022\t Provide written vaccine information to the family prior \nto administering the medication.\n\u2022\t Routine childhood vaccines can be safely adminis\u00ad\ntered simultaneously.\nPediatric nurses are in the perfect position to deliver \neffective anticipatory guidance for the families whom they \nserve. Preventing infections and communicable diseases is \npart of an important teaching plan for families, both to help \nthem recognize warning signs and so that they will know \nwhat to expect over the course of the child\u2019s development. \nMost important, the nurse needs to teach families how to \nparticipate in prevention of illnesses for their children. The \nmost important topics to discuss with families of infants and \nchildren as means to prevent illnesses are good nutrition, \nadequate rest, personal hand hygiene to prevent the spread \nor acquisition of communicable diseases, and completion \nof the childhood immunization schedule.\nAnnual Recommended Schedules\nPediatric nurses should stay up-to-date with any changes \nto the proposed immunization schedule and keep the \nContraindications to Immunization\nIt is important for the healthcare team to fully understand \nand verify the rationale when making the decision to \nwithhold the administration of required immunizations \nto a child. The following conditions are most commonly \n374\t\nChapter 26\u2003 Infection and Communicable Diseases in Childhood\n", "research shows that neither the MMR vaccine nor \nvaccines in general, with or without thimerosal, \ncause autism (Hurley, Tadrous, & Miller, 2010; Jain \net\u00a0al., 2015; Taylor, Swerdfeger, & Eslick, 2014).\n\u2022\t The rotavirus vaccine is dangerous. There is a slight \nassociation between the rotavirus vaccine and in\u00ad\ntussusception, but this outcome is rare and not con\u00ad\nsidered dangerous enough to justify withholding \nimmunization.\n\u2022\t Vaccine ingredients are toxic and contain mercury, \nformaldehyde, and aluminum.

Overall immunization rates vary by geography, but \nrange from 83% to 93%, on average (CDC, 2015b). Parental \nconcerns, misconceptions, and inadequate education all \ninfluence national immunization rates. The following list \ngives examples of common misconceptions:\n\u2022\t MMR vaccines and vaccines containing the preserva\u00ad\ntive thimerosal cause autism. Extensive scientific \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nDoes the Influenza Vaccine Cause Febrile Seizures?\nThe influenza vaccine has been recommended for all infants \nsince 1973. Although the risk is only slightly higher, infants who \nreceive the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine concomitantly \nwhen they receive the pneumococcal (PCV13 or PCV7) or DTaP \nvaccine are at an increased risk for febrile seizures. Research \nsuggests that the risk of a febrile seizure during the first few days \nafter the vaccines are administered is less of a concern than the \nrisk of febrile seizures for children who are not vaccinated for the \nhost of childhood infectious and communicable diseases, some \nof which have a potential to be life threatening (Duffy et\u00a0al., 2016).\n\t\nChildhood Immunizations\t\n375\n", "5.\t Do not use alcohol, detergents, hydrogen peroxide, \nor iodine on the wound, as these products may delay \nwound healing through epithelialization.\n6.\t In fresh wounds, assess the wound carefully for \npebbles, dirt, debris, clots, or any material that may \ndelay wound healing. In previously treated wounds, \nassess for sloughing tissue and eschar; the presence \nof both can delay wound healing.\n7.\t Assess the need for stitches. Absorbable or natural \nmaterial such as catgut should be used to close the \ninner layers of a deep wound and will absorb com\u00ad\npletely within two months. Non-absorbable sutures, \nwhich are used for top-layer closure, are made of a \nthread material such as silk or synthetic fibers and \nmust be removed when the wound has healed.\n8.\t Pat the wound dry with clean gauze or a new sec\u00ad\ntion of the very clean cloth.\n9.\t Dress the wound as needed to provide a barrier \ncover to prevent microbial contamination.\nOnce the initial phases of fresh wound healing begin, a \nchild\u2019s wound should heal rapidly and without complica\u00ad\ntions.

This is a myth. Only severe \nfebrile illness should prompt rescheduling of childhood im\u00ad\nmunizations. A presentation of a cough, rhinorrhea, or mild \nviral illness such as an ear infection does not necessarily \nrequire postponement of vaccines. Work with the pediatric \nteam to determine the best outcome. Given that the current \nU.S. immunization rate is below the national health goal, it \nis imperative to determine whether there is a valid reason \nto withhold immunization when a family had planned on \ncoming to the clinic.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nEMLA and the Control of Discomfort During \nImmunizations\nEMLA cream (topical eutectic mixture of local anesthetics\u2014\nlidocaine and prilocaine) has been shown to relieve pain \nduring routine child vaccine appointments. Placing the \ncream on the injection site at least 20 minutes prior to the \ninjection may be challenging but effective.\nFigure 26-3\u2002 If the wound is deep or concerning, the child should \nbe evaluated. \n\u00a9 Sean_Warren/iStock /Getty Images Plus/Getty\nWound Infections\nIn addition to infections via communicable diseases, chil\u00ad\ndren are prone to experiencing significant skin scrapes, \nexcoriations, and open wounds. If the wound is deep \nor concerning, the child should be evaluated for wound \ncleansing, stitches to promote healing, and possible oral \nantibiotics if infection is present or suspected (Figure 26-3).\nTypical small wounds, such as scrapes, abrasions, and \nshallow cuts, should be managed at home; parents can be \ntaught to follow basic wound care guidelines. For wounds \nseen in the clinic, the following process should be used:\n1.\t Always clean hands thoroughly before touching a \nchild\u2019s open wound.

Common \ncues as to the cause are \u00adco-occurring infections and the \nappearance of discharge (CDC, 2016b): Viral conjunctivitis \nusually has watery discharge and coincides with respiratory \ninfections; bacterial conjunctivitis discharge is generally \nthick rather than watery and coincides with otitis media; \nforeign bodies present with heavy tear production and a \nsensation of \u201cgrit\u201d in the eye; and allergic conjunctivitis is \nusually seasonal, accompanied by intense itching of the \neyes, and often occurs in children who have other allergic \nor atopic conditions (e.g., eczema). In severe cases or cases \nwith complicating factors such as immune deficiency, con\u00ad\ntact lens use, or treatment failure, laboratory evaluation of \nexudate may be necessary to determine appropriate treat\u00ad\nment (Cronau, Kankanala, & Mauger, 2010). In neonates, \nmaternally transmitted infections such as chlamydia, her\u00ad\npesvirus, or other bacterial contaminants acquired during \nbirth can be the cause; alternatively, blocked tear ducts or \n(ironically) topical medications used for prevention of \nbacterial conjunctivitis can cause the condition.\nRisk Factors\nBoth viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are extremely \n\u00adcontagious (readily spread through direct and indirect \ncontact), and contact with another child who has conjunc\u00ad\ntivitis should raise suspicion for transmission via droplets \nor hand\u2013eye contact. Presence of certain infections in the \nmother (gonorrhea, chlamydia) raises the risk of neonatal \nchildren; the care of a child with an infection also requires \nthoughtful consideration and prospective care planning. \nIn particular, the nurse should keep in mind the follow\u00ad\ning factors:\n\u2022\t The location, extent, severity, and clinical presenta\u00ad\ntion of the wound or infectious process\n\u2022\t Sensitivity of the microorganism to antimicro\u00ad\nbial therapy, including the minimal bactericidal \n\u00adconcentration (MBC), which determines the \namount of therapy needed to achieve 99.9% \n\u00adbacterial kill\n\u2022\t Age of the child and ability to participate in and \ncomply with therapy, including leaving the wound \nalone to heal without picking, scraping, or chewing \noff dressings\n\u2022\t The child\u2019s immune system, nutritional status, and \noverall general health\u2014presence of comorbidities \nmay reduce the ability of the child\u2019s immune system \nto launch an effective healing process\n\u2022\t Presence of allergies, history of allergic reac\u00ad\ntions, and development of tolerance to the therapy \n\u00ad(development of nausea, antimicrobial-associated \ndiarrhea, and rashes or skin reactions)\nPediatric nurses are often requested to provide an\u00ad\nticipatory guidance and teaching on childhood infections, \nincluding their transmission, incubation periods, classical \nsigns and associated symptoms, treatments, and academic \nattendance guidelines.\nMost children with infections are managed outside the \nhospital setting. Common childhood infections such as \notitis media, impetigo, cellulitis, and small wound infections \nmay need to be initially assessed in a pediatric healthcare \nsetting, then subsequently treated and managed at home. \nIn contrast, children who present with immune immatu\u00ad\nrity or immune compromise, or who have a complicated \ninfectious process, will most likely be hospitalized for \nintravenous antimicrobial therapy.\nConcept Exemplars\nThe following infectious diseases are used as concept ex\u00ad\nemplars: conjunctivitis, fifth disease, thrush, and impetigo.\nConjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis, or \u201cpink eye,\u201d is an infection of the membrane \ncovering the white of the eye. It is a common condition \nin children of all ages, including newborns, although the \ncauses in newborns may be slightly different. Causes of \nconjunctivitis vary, with infection by bacterial and viral \npathogens at one end of the spectrum and airborne chemi\u00ad\ncals or allergens (e.g., pollen) at the other.\nFigure 26-4\u2002 Conjuctivitis is easy to identify by its symptoms of red\u00ad\nness, swelling, and discharge. \n\u00a9 Sharon Mccutcheon /EyeEm/Getty Images\n\t\nConcept Exemplars\t\n377\n", "Diagnosis\nFifth disease typically starts as a nonspecific set of symp\u00ad\ntoms: fever, runny nose, and headache. After several days, \nthe \u201cslapped cheek\u201d facial rash that is characteristic of this \ninfection develops, followed by a more generalized, some\u00ad\ntimes itchy, rash on the rest of the body (Figure 26-5). Total \nduration of the infection from onset to disappearance of \nthe rash is generally 10 to 14 days. Joint pain, which some\u00ad\ntimes accompanies parvovirus B19 infections in adults, is \nrare in children.\nBecause most children with healthy immune response \ndevelop full immunity, the infection is usually a one-time \noccurrence. Children with immune deficiency, however, \nmay not develop full immunity and are vulnerable to re\u00ad\ninfection (CDC, 2015e).\nRisk Factors\nChildren who attend school or daycare programs are most \nlikely to be exposed to parvovirus B19. Children who have \nhad fifth disease already are at low risk unless they have \nan immune defect. Once the rash develops, the child is no \nlonger contagious (CDC, 2015e).\nMedical Treatment and Nursing Care\nTreatment is supportive and focused on symptom relief, as \nthe disease is self-limiting, except in those children at risk \nof complications due to immune deficiency. Nursing care \nshould focus on primary prevention practices and teaching \nabout management of symptoms. Appropriate administra\u00ad\ntion of analgesics and fever reducers to prevent overdose \nshould be emphasized, particularly in very young children. \nGood hand hygiene, avoidance of hand\u2012eye contact, and \ncovering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing \nare important practices to prevent transmission. Young \nconjunctivitis. Children older than 5 years have lower risk \nof contracting infectious conjunctivitis due to improved \nhygiene. Allergies and atopy are risk factors for allergic \nconjunctivitis. Children with blepharitis\u2014an inflammatory \ncondition that supports bacterial growth in the eyelid\u2014are \nat risk of chronic or recurrent infection (CDC, 2016b).\nMedical Treatment\nTreatment of viral conjunctivitis is supportive and empha\u00ad\nsizes hand washing, cold compresses on the eye to reduce \nswelling, and artificial tears if needed to soothe irritation. \nOtherwise, the disease is usually self-limiting and resolves \nin 7 to 10 days without intervention (Cronau et\u00a0al., 2010). \nCases that last longer may need ocular steroid therapy and \nshould be referred to an ophthalmologist.\nAcute bacterial conjunctivitis follows the same treatment \nprotocol as viral conjunctivitis, but is additionally treated \nwith ocular antibiotic ointment. Treatment of bacterial \ninfections may be handled by primary care practitioners, \nbut chronic (recurring for at least 4 weeks) and hyperacute \n(sudden-onset with excessive, purulent discharge) infec\u00ad\ntions should be referred to an ophthalmologist.\nAllergic conjunctivitis is managed using antihistamines \n(either oral or topical), allergen avoidance, and artificial \ntears. Foreign body\u2012related conjunctivitis should prompt \nevaluation for corneal abrasion, including assessing for \nthe presence of a retained foreign body adhering to the \neyelid (Cronau et\u00a0al., 2010). In neonates, blocked tear \nducts are managed with gentle rubbing of the eye to \ndislodge the blockage, but if the problem continues be\u00ad\nyond 1 year of age, surgical intervention may be needed \n(CDC, 2016b).\nNursing Care\nNursing care should focus on primary prevention practices. \nGood hand hygiene and avoidance of hand\u2012eye contact is \nessential for conjunctivitis prevention. Young children must \nbe taught and then reminded to participate in adequate \nhand hygiene, and family members need to role model \nbest practices.\nIf the cause of the conjunctivitis is bacterial, the fam\u00ad\nily should be reminded to use the full dose of antibiotic \nointment as prescribed to limit microbial resistance. If \nthe cause is allergic, teaching should include allergen \navoidance.\nFifth Disease (Erythema Infectiosum)\nFifth disease, also called erythema infectiosum, is a common \nviral infection caused by parvovirus B19 (CDC, 2015e). It \ngot its name by virtue of being traditionally listed fifth in \nclassifications of illnesses that frequently cause skin rash \nin children.\nFigure 26-5\u2002 Fifth disease is characterized by the \u201cslapped cheek\u201d \nfacial rash.\n\u00a9 Diomedia/ISM\n378\t\nChapter 26\u2003 Infection and Communicable Diseases in Childhood\n", "is more common with sexual activity. Urogenital thrush \nand intertrigo may also be a product of poor hygiene and \nuse of towels or clothing belonging to others.\nMedical Treatment and Nursing Care\nIn infants, oral thrush is self-limiting. Urogenital thrush \ncan be managed with appropriate hygiene and management \nto limit moisture in the diaper area (e.g., more frequent \ndiaper changes). Diaper rash creams can be used to alle\u00ad\nviate irritation. Vaginal candidiasis and intertrigo may be \ntreated with topical or systemic antifungal medications.\nNursing care includes teaching new parents how to \nmanage diaper rash and educating adolescents about hy\u00ad\ngiene and prevention. In sexually active teens, discussion \nof the importance of preventing other sexually transmitted \ndiseases (STDs) may be an important facet of nursing care \nfor urogenital candidiasis.\nImpetigo\nImpetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in \nchildren (Cole & Gazewood, 2007). It is most frequently \ncaused by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and, less \nfrequently, Streptococcus pyogenes, which are commonly \npresent on the skin\u2019s surface. Impetigo is generally not \nserious except when it develops in concert with scabies (a \nparasitic mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, that burrows in the skin), \nin which case it can lead to serious complications (Romani, \nSteer, Whitfield, & Kaldor, 2015).\nTwo forms of impetigo are distinguished: bullous and \nnonbullous. The former presents as perioral or perinasal \nvesicles that rupture to form a dark yellow crust, while \nthe latter presents as fragile, transparent bullae that may \nappear anywhere on the body (Lewis, 2016) (Figure 26-7). \nNonbullous impetigo is highly contagious and usually \nresolves on its own in about 2 weeks. Bullous impetigo \nchildren must be taught and then reminded to participate \nin adequate hand hygiene, and family members need to \nrole model best practices.\nThrush (Candidiasis)\nThrush (candidiasis) in children may be either an oro\u00ad\npharyngeal or urogenital infection with the yeast Candida \nalbicans. Oropharyngeal infections occur primarily in \ninfants. Urogenital infections occur in infants and tod\u00ad\ndlers (diaper dermatitis) or in adolescent girls (\u201cyeast \ninfections\u201d). Intertrigo\u2014candidiasis of the skin folds of the \ngroin, armpits, and torso\u2014may also occur in overweight \nchildren, particularly if poor hygiene practices are present.\nDiagnosis\nOral candidiasis presents as white plaques in the mouth that \nresemble cottage cheese (Jain, Jain, & Rawat, 2010). If the \nplaques are scraped away, the mucosa beneath is reddened \nand sore, and may bleed (Figure 26-6). Cracking in the \ncorners of the mouth (angular cheilitis) is a concomitant \nsymptom. Oral candidiasis is most common in infants, but \nmay occur in children who have been recently treated with \nantibiotics and steroids due to the effects of the medications \non the normal oral flora.\nUrogenital candidiasis in infants presents as a red rash \nwith a clearly defined border that is deepest in the folds of \nthe groin and buttocks; suspicion of candidiasis should be \nraised by any significant diaper rash lasting more than 2 or \n3 days with treatment (Jain et\u00a0al., 2010). Vaginal candidiasis \nin adolescents is characterized by intense itching of the \ngenitals; thick, white discharge; and redness in the groin area.\nRisk Factors\nOral and urogenital thrush are not unusual in infants, \nparticularly newborns.

Stopping \nwhen the child feels better, no longer has fevers \n(if present), or appears to be well or free of infec\u00ad\ntion symptoms contributes to the development of \nresistant strains and may cause a reinfection if the \nmicrobe is still present and not completely treated.\n\u2022\t Report a wound, rash, or infection that does not \nrespond to medications or heals more slowly than \nexpected.\n\u2022\t Prevent secondary infections in infants and young \nchildren by preventing children from scratching \ntheir wounds and contaminating them with dirt, \nfeces, or other contaminates.\nHospital-Acquired Infections\nWhen hospitalized, children have an increased vulnerabil\u00ad\nity to experiencing infection with a variety of microbes. \nChildren who undergo surgical manipulation may show \nsigns of infection within 16 hours of a surgical procedure. \nThe presence of urinary catheters, peripheral or central \nvenous catheters, endotracheal (ET) tubes, or other lines \nwhere normal protective mechanisms are breached cre\u00ad\nates a vulnerability to nosocomial infection, also known \nas hospital-acquired infection (HAI).\nThe likelihood of contracting a HAI depends on the \npresence of invasive tubes, length of stay in the hospital \nenvironment, type of surgical procedure, use or overuse of \nantibiotics (Table 26-4), presence of a wound, hand hygiene \nof caregivers, and the location in the hospital where the \nchild stays. Hospital days spent in a pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU) increase a child\u2019s vulnerability to HAI. \nThe infections most typically acquired in hospitals are \nhospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), catheter-associated \nurinary tract infections (CAUTI), wound infections, and \nhospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HABSI) (CDC.\ngov, 2016c).\nis less contagious but may provoke systemic symptoms if \nlesions are widespread (Lewis, 2016). Approximately 70% \nof cases are nonbullous impetigo; the majority of bullous \nimpetigo cases occur in infants.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on clinical appearance and history. In \nsituations where outbreaks are common or if the child \nhas recently been hospitalized, culture of exudate beneath \nscabbed-over lesions may be needed to rule out possible \nmethicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection (Lewis, \n2016).\nRisk Factors\nImpetigo may develop in children who have a history of \nminor trauma, insect bites, scabies, eczema, or any other \ncondition that promotes an itchy rash; abrasions due to \nscratching are often a cause of infection. Risk is increased in \nchildren with a family member or close associate who has \na streptococcal or staphylococcal infection. Poor hygiene; \nhot, humid living conditions; and crowded living quarters \ncan put children at risk.\nMedical Treatment and Nursing Care\nTreatment of impetigo involves direct wound care of \nthe lesions plus appropriate antibiotic therapy with an \nagent that is active against both S. aureus and S. pyogenes. \nTopical mupirocin or retapamulin are preferred agents for \nnonbullous impetigo that presents with single lesions, but \nsystemic antibiotics are used when there is extensive skin \ninvolvement or when an outbreak occurs in a family, on \nan athletic team, or in a daycare setting. In infants with \nwidespread bullous impetigo that has multiple ruptured \nlesions, dehydration and sepsis are concerns and inpatient \ntreatment is warranted (Lewis, 2016).\nAs with other infectious processes, nursing care should \ninitially focus on primary prevention practices. Good \nhygiene\u2014particularly hand washing\u2014is the key to infec\u00ad\ntion prevention. Young children must be taught and then \nreminded to participate in adequate hand hygiene, and \nfamily members need to role model best practices.\nWhen a child presents with an infection, nursing care \nincludes determining the severity of the infection and \ncommunicating assessments to the medical team for \ntreatment.

Young \nchildren and infants are prone to contracting infections \ndue to their immature immune systems. Children enter\u00ad\ning childcare facilities and school environments become \nrapidly exposed to infectious materials due to their in\u00ad\ncreased socialization in these settings and encounters \nwith other children who may be under-immunized or \ninfected due to older siblings\u2019 exposure.\n\u25c6\u25c6The normal flora on a child\u2019s skin and intestines provide \na first line of protection from disease-causing fungi and \nbacteria, help to manufacture vitamin K (essential for \nclotting factors), and assist in the breakdown and diges\u00ad\ntion of food. Breaches in the protective layer of normal \nflora are caused by breaks in skin integrity, allowing for \ninfectious invasion of harmful microbes.\n\u25c6\u25c6Factors associated with the development of childhood \ninfections include genetics, family hygiene practices, \nthe child\u2019s age, immunity status, nutritional status, \nchronic disorders such as diabetes, and overall general \nhealth. The youngest children\u2019s developmental stage \nhighly influences transmission and reception of infec\u00ad\ntious materials due to their oral fixation and inability \nto control secretions.\n\u25c6\u25c6Immunizations administered during childhood include \nthe DTaP, MMR, polio, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, and \nvaricella vaccines. Other childhood vaccines include the \nannual influenza and rotavirus vaccines, as indicated.\n\u25c6\u25c6The pediatric nurse\u2019s role in childhood immunizations \nincludes accurate administration of the correct vaccine, \nin the correct dose, at the correct site, and with the cor\u00ad\nrect timing; parent/guardian education on aspects of \nthe immunization being administered; assessment for \ncontraindications to administration; and assessment of \nside effects or reactions.\n\u25c6\u25c6Several complexities surround childhood immuniza\u00ad\ntions, including parental refusal of vaccines due to \ncultural beliefs, religious beliefs, and fears about the \nvaccines.

It is imperative that the nurse be aware of \nessential skills requiring adaptation for children. This \nchapter outlines important tips and information needed \nto safely and effectively apply skills to children of varying \nages. The skills discussed here have been selected based on \ntheir frequency of use in pediatric acute care, home care, \nand clinic settings. If you are new to pediatrics, seek the \nassistance of an experienced nurse who is accustomed to \nadapting equipment to children, or who is familiar with \napplying principles of child development consideration to \nthe application of skills. Important aspects of safely and \naccurately implementing nursing skills to children who \nmay not be cooperative during skills procedures include \npreparedness and confidence.\nWhenever possible, elicit the help of a Child Life team \nmember. These specialists are highly trained in develop\u00ad\nmentally educating and preparing a child for a skill or \nprocedure. They are well equipped to provide distraction \nduring the procedure, and can help with the patient\u2019s physi\u00ad\ncal and emotional recovery after a procedure that causes \nfear, anxiety, or discomfort.\nPain assessment and control are essential during pro\u00ad\ncedures. Investigate policies and practices surrounding \ninstitutional pain control measures for invasive procedures. \nOffer and encourage the pain-reducing intervention of \nEMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) or 4% lido\u00ad\ncaine cream topically for invasive needle-based procedures \nsuch as intravenous (IV) line placements, intramuscular \n(IM) and subcutaneous (SQ) injections, and skin biopsies. \nOffer a vibrating device such as the Buzzy (Figure 27-1) \nto provide nerve distraction during painful procedures. \nIn general, if possible, plan ahead, create a plan of action, \nprovide education, take child developmental considerations \ninto account, and assemble equipment that will promote \ncomfort during a skill procedure that might be frightening \nor cause discomfort.\nWhenever possible, a parent should stay with a child \nduring a skills procedure. The performance of a skill that \nproduces discomfort should be done in a pediatric treat\u00ad\nment room. The parent should be encouraged to stay in \nthis room and provide comfort to the child. The parent \nshould be outside the area where the team is performing \nthe skill, but close enough to provide visual contact and \nsoothing support to the child. If the child is reasonably \nrelaxed, having him or her sit on the parent\u2019s lap or lie on \nthe parent\u2019s chest (Figure 27-2) may be less traumatic, \nbut only in limited situations (e.g., injections). It should \nnot be attempted for more invasive procedures such as \nblood draws, placement of IV lines, and so forth, because \nhaving the parent hold the child during a venipuncture or \nprocedure to start an IV increases the risk that the nurse \nwill get accidentally stuck with the needle as well as the \nrisk that the child will need to be stuck multiple times \nbecause the parent inadvertently impedes the nurse\u2019s line \nof sight or fails to hold the child tightly enough. In such \nsituations, another nurse or a physician\u2019s assistant who \nknows the correct techniques for restraining a child should \nbe summoned to assist.\nFigure 27-1\u2002 Vibrating devices, such as the Buzzy, provide nerve \ndistraction during painful procedures.\nPotts, D., Davis, K.

Healthcare \ninstitutions vary in their skills procedures, physician orders, \nmonitoring requirements, and equipment. The information in \nthis chapter is based on the usual norms and evidence-based \npractice, but should not be used in place of your institution\u2019s \nprotocols and procedures. Do not deviate in terms of your \nskills performance or choice of equipment from the set and \napproved institutional policies.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nK\nnow your scope of practice! Do not perform skills or pro\u00ad\ncedures on children without a direct physician\u2019s or primary \nhealthcare provider\u2019s written (or electronic) order set. Pediatric \nregistered nurses must be competent in skills performance \nbut should always practice with safety, knowledge of scope \nof practice within the state they are practicing, and a skills \ncompetency checklist.\n\t\nIntroduction\t\n387\n", "QUALITY AND SAFETY\nK\neep assessment and procedure equipment safely stored \naway from a child\u2019s reach. In all healthcare settings, the \npediatric nurse must be acutely aware of where instruments \nfor assessment, supplies for specimen collection, medications \nfor administration, or any unsafe piece of equipment is at all \ntimes. Leaving any equipment or medication at the bedside \ncan lead to a safety risk. Children have been known to swallow \nmedications that were not theirs if a sweet liquid was added \nto the medication. Children have also been known to cut \ntheir central venous catheter lines, urinary drainage tunes, \nIV therapy lines, or other tubes, drains, or lines with scissors \ninnocently left at the child\u2019s bedside.\nFigure 27-2\u2002 A child can sit on the parent\u2019s lap or lie on the parent\u2019s \nchest during a skills procedure if he or she is reasonably relaxed.\n\u00a9 Glow Wellness/Glow/Getty Images\nFigure 27-3\u2002 A mummy wrap offers gentle restraint to help an infant \nor small child feel more secure.\nFigure 27-4\u2002 A variety of blood pressure cuffs are found in pediatric \nnursing care.\narm circumference\nNEONATE\n6 t\no 1\n1 c\nm\n10 to 18 cm\nINFANT\narm c\nirc\nu\nmference\nBladd\ner s\niz\ne 7.2\n x 13\n cm\nCHILD\n18 to 26 cm\narm c\nirc\nu\nmference\nBladd\ner s\niz\ne 9.6\n x 18\n c\nm\nADULT\n25 to 35 cm\narm c\nirc\nu\nm\nfere\nnce\nBladde\nr si\nze\n 13.1 x \n23.5\n c\nm\nLARGE ADULT\n33 to 47 cm\narm c\nirc\nu\nmferenc\ne\nBladd\ner s\niz\ne 16\n.5 x \n32 \nc\nm\nIf the child is frightened and is likely to fight against the \nparent, nurse, and team during the procedure, it may be \nappropriate and safe to wrap the child in a mummy wrap. \nWith this precaution, the child feels the security of the \nwrap and the team is able to place a gentle restraint on all \nof the child\u2019s extremities but the one required for the skill \nprocedure (Figure 27-3).\nTaking Vital Signs in Children\nRespiratory Rate\nA respiratory rate should be counted for one full minute \nwhenever possible. Newborns and young infants have vari\u00ad\nable respiratory rates and patterns. Accuracy is achieved \nwith a full minute count of breaths.\nHeart Rate\nHeart rates should be taken apically using the diaphragm \nof a pediatric stethoscope and counted for a full minute. \nNurses should avoid taking this vital sign from a heart \nrate monitor, as accuracy can be greatly compromised \nwith this approach.\nBlood Pressure\nA variety of blood pressure cuffs are found in pediatric \nnursing care (Figure 27-4). It is important to measure the \ndistance between the shoulder (acromion process) and the \nantecubital space in the inner elbow the first time a blood \npressure is taken. The cuff should cover two-thirds of the \ndistance between these two points. If the cuff is too small, \n388\t\nChapter 27\u2003 Essential Skills for Pediatric Nursing\n", "the blood pressure reading will be falsely elevated. If the \ncuff is too big, the blood pressure reading may be too low.\nOxygen Saturation\nOxygen saturation readings provide information on the \nindirect measurement of the percentage of circulating red \nblood cells that are saturated with oxygen molecules. Direct \nmeasurements are taken in the form of arterial blood gas \nreadings. Infants and toddlers do well with having the \noxygen probe placed on a toe and then covered with a \nsock. For active young children, reinforcement with tape \nmay be required to keep the pulse oximeter probe in place. \nOlder children can easily keep a finger oxygen saturation \nprobe in place.\nMonitor saturation readings carefully after each change \nin oxygen therapy. Saturation readings may take a few \nminutes to display accurate saturations after any change \nin oxygen delivery quantity. The exact time to accurate \nreading depends on the probe location, probe adherence, \nand hemodynamic stability of the child.\nTemperature\nThe most common means to measure temperatures are \naxillary readings in young children and oral readings in \nolder children. Rectal temperatures are rarely taken due \nto the risk of injury from perforation. An older child, with \nguidance, can have an oral temperature taken; instructions \nshould be to place the tip of the probe under the tongue or \nalong the inner cheek, without biting, and to close the lips \nentirely. Do not use glass/mercury thermometers orally in \nchildren, especially if they are developmentally delayed or \ncognitively impaired. A child who bites down on a glass \nthermometer risks severe injury and mercury exposure.\nto this form of temperature reading, and it is not safe \nin patients with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. \nRectal temperature measurements are also inaccurate \nin the presence of large amounts of stool.\n\u2022\t Tympanic: This type of reading is not affected by \neither otitis media infections or the presence of ceru\u00ad\nmen. If the light on the probe is accurately shone on \nthe tympanic membrane, the resulting measurement \nis considered more accurate than rectal measurement \nof temperature (Paes, Vermeulen, Brohet, van der \nPloeg, & de Winter, 2010).\n\u2022\t Oral: Children who recently consumed fluids or foods \nprior to oral readings can influence the measure\u00ad\nment. The presence of oxygen delivery has also been \nshown to influence the accuracy of oral temperature \nmeasurement.\n\u2022\t Skin: Research has shown a variability of 28% to 90% \nin the accuracy of temperature measurement using \na skin-applied color-coded flat thermometer. This \ntechnique should not be used in critically ill children, \nchildren with neutropenia, or children with skin le\u00ad\nsions or conditions.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nT\nhe goal of measuring a child\u2019s temperature is to ascer\u00ad\ntain an accurate core body temperature, indicating the \ntemperature of blood that bathes the tissues of the brain\u2019s \nhypothalamus. Research has shown that many variables influ\u00ad\nence the accuracy of temperature measurements in children \n(Robinson, 2004). The following body sites are currently used \nto take temperatures in the United States:\n\u2022\t Axillary: The probe must be placed over the axillary \nartery. All variations of thermometers read axillary \ntemperatures below core body temperatures, leading \nto possibly inaccurate readings.\n\u2022\t Rectal: Readings taken at this site measure tempera\u00ad\ntures at a great distance from the hypothalamus; thus, \nchanges in body temperature are often not rapidly \ndetected in this anatomic area. Children are resistant \nEssential Calculations\nPediatric nurses require knowledge of child-specific calcula\u00ad\ntions. The following sections present common calculations \nrequired for safe care.\nFluid Maintenance\nSick children are at risk for inadequate consumption of oral \nfluids. Because the amount of fluid needed differs depending \non the child\u2019s weight, a pediatric nurse will calculate a safe \nquantity of fluid unique for the child to provide fluid main\u00ad\ntenance; correction of fluid deficits with conditions such \nas dehydration requires a separate calculation. Fluid needs \nare determined in milliliters per kilogram of body weight, \nwhich must then be converted to identify the appropriate \ndose rate to provide the needed amount per unit of time, \nusually 1 hour. With oral fluids, the dose for 1 or more hours \nmay be given in a marked cup or bottle so that the nurse \ncan track how much the child is actually drinking during \nthat time frame (and encourage the child to drink more if \nhe or she is consuming too little). Fluid maintenance doses \nare also often calculated to determine the rate of infusion \nof the initial IV therapy in units of milliliters per hour. A \nnurse may be given a specific IV fluid and then an order \nto run the fluid at \u201cone times maintenance\u201d rate or \u201chalf \nmaintenance\u201d rate if there is concern with overhydration. \nIn a specific circumstance in which the child needs to have \nextra fluids, such as in preparation for chemotherapy, the \nphysician may order \u201ctwo times maintenance,\u201d allowing for \na larger volume to lower the child\u2019s urine specific gravity, \n\t\nEssential Calculations\t\n389\n", "2.\t Divided by 3600\n3.\t Find the square root of the number\nBSA\nW\nH\n=\n\u00d7\n3600\nBody Mass Index Calculation\nThe child\u2019s body mass index (BMI) is calculated as follows:\nChild\u2019s weight (in kilograms) \u00f7 child\u2019s height \n(in meters squared) [or BSA]\nor\n[Child\u2019s weight (in pounds) \u00d7 703] \u00f7 child\u2019s height \n(in inches squared)\nKilocalorie Calculation\nPediatric nursing spans the care of children across the devel\u00ad\nopmental period, from prematurity through late adolescence \nand sometimes into young adulthood. The determination \nof how many calories are needed for adequate growth and \ndevelopment in children across the developmental period \ndepends on the child\u2019s age and weight. In older children \n(older than 9 years), sex is also taken into account, as caloric \nneeds for girls are slightly lower from about age 9 onward \n(U.S. Department of Agriculture & U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, 2010).\nFamilies often want to know how many calories, on \naverage, their child should consume daily. A standard \ncalculation can assist in that common question. One must \ntake into consideration the child\u2019s overall activity level, \nage, and sex, and make allowances for overweight or un\u00ad\nderweight status. Children who are athletes and play on \none or more sports teams will need to adjust the kilocalorie \nrequirement upward to provide adequate energy. Although \nseveral kilocalorie calculations can be used, all of which \nproduce similar findings, the following calculation is com\u00ad\nmonly used across pediatric nursing:\n\u2022\t 0\u201330 days: 100\u2013110 kcal/kg/day.\n\u2022\t 1\u20134 months: 90\u2013100 kcal/kg/day.\n\u2022\t 5 months to 5 years: 70\u201390 kcal/kg/day.\n\u2022\t Older than 5 years: 1500 kcal for the first 20 kg \nof weight, then an additional 25 kcal for each \n\u00adadditional 1 kg of weight greater than 20 kg. Thus, \nto calculate an older child\u2019s daily caloric intake, the \nfollowing formula is used: 1500 kcal + ([weight in \nkg \u2013 20 kg] \u00d7 25 kcal) = total caloric need per day.\nIn an overweight or obese child, the total amount of \nkilocalories needed may exceed what would normally be \nconsidered adequate for a child of that age. For example, \nhydrate the child well, and prepare for the administration \nof a nephrotoxic drug.\nFluid Maintenance Calculation\nWeight in kilograms\t\nMultiply by mL/day\nFirst 10 kg (0\u201310 kg)\t\n100 mL\nSecond 10 kg (11\u201320)\t\n\u00071000 mL plus 50 mL more\n\u2003 \u2003 for each kg between \n\u2003 \u2003 11 and\u00a020 kg\n21\u201370 kg\t\n\u00071500 mL plus 20 mL for \n\u2003 \u2003 each kg between \n\u2003 \u2003 21 and 70\u00a0kg\nExamples:\nPatient weight\t\nCalculation\n6 kg\t\n\u0007100 mL \u00d7 6 = 600 mL/day or \n\u2003 \u2003 600 mL \u00f7 24 hr = 25 mL/hr\n13.5 kg\t\n\u00071000 mL + (3.5 \u00d7 50 mL) = \n\u2003 \u2003 1175 mL/day or 1175 mL \u00f7 \n\u2003 \u2003 24 hr = 48.9 mL/hr\n27 kg\t\n\u00071500 mL + (7 \u00d7 20 mL) = \n\u2003 \u2003 1640 mL/day or 1640 mL \u00f7 \n\u2003 \u2003 24 hr = 68.3 mL/hr\nOral Rehydration Therapy\nChildren who are able to take oral (PO) fluids (i.e., children \nwho are not vomiting) should have their dehydration or \nfluid losses replaced through oral rehydration therapy \n(ORT). ORT is typically used in young children with \nacute gastroenteritis\u2014a common viral infection leading to \nsignificant watery stool loss. Most orders will include the \nadministration of an electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte. \nDo not use sugary drinks, juices, or soda to replace fluids \norally; they contain sugar, which will draw fluids to the \nbowel and cause the child to have more stool loss.\nORT is calculated as follows:\n\u2022\t Children older than 1 year of age: 30\u201360 mL of \n\u00adelectrolyte solution PO every hour as tolerated.\n\u2022\t Younger infants: Introduce 15 mL of electrolyte \n\u00adsolution in a bottle every 2 hours.\n\u2022\t Older infants: Introduce 15\u201330 mL electrolyte \n\u00adsolution in a bottle every 2 hours.\nBody Surface Area Calculation\nBody surface area (BSA), or meters squared (m2), is used \nto determine the dose of specific medications. Intravenous \nimmunoglobulins and chemotherapy medications are \ntypically given in a dose related to the child\u2019s BSA. The \nfollowing calculation is used to determine BSA:\n1.\t Weight (in kilograms) multiplied by height (in \ncentimeters)\n390\t\nChapter 27\u2003 Essential Skills for Pediatric Nursing\n", "Minimum Urine Output Calculation\nThe minimum urine output (UOP) calculation must not \nbe used as a measure of adequate hydration in children. \nRather, it designates that the child\u2019s kidney function is \nintact\u2014not that the child has adequate daily hydration. \nThe goal of urine output is much higher. The calculation \nfor minimum UOP is as follows:\n\u2022\t Infants: 2 mL/kg/hr\n\u2022\t Children (1\u201312 years): 1 mL/kg/hr\n\u2022\t Adolescents (13\u201319 years): 0.5\u20131 mL/kg/hr\nBurn Fluid Resuscitation Calculation\nChildren who suffer significant burns usually require a \nfluid resuscitation calculation. The post-burn resuscitation \ncalculations require the previously determined percentage \nof body surface area burned. Using a standard chart, the \nnurse will assist the emergency care team to determine this \npercentage, typically by using the Lund-Brower chart. Two \nexamples of these calculations are found in Table 27-1.\na 4 foot 10 inch, 11-year-old boy who weighs 130 pounds \n(approximately 59 kg) is considered overweight, with a BMI \nof 26.3; according to the formula, he would require 2475 \nkcal per day\u2014within the acceptable range of 2000\u20132600 kcal \nsuggested by the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute \n(2013) if the child is very active, but excessive (and therefore \nexacerbating his weight concerns) if he is sedentary. The \nopposite is true of an underweight child, who may need \nadditional caloric support beyond the amount suggested \nby the calculation to encourage weight gain.\nCaloric Intake in Infants\nStandard over-the-counter infant formulas provide 20 kcal/\nounce once prepared. It is easy to determine how many \nounces of formula the infant should consume: Simply divide \nthe total kilocalorie daily requirement by 20, which would \nthen give the number of ounces needed.\nAs an example of calculating the kilocalorie needs and \nformula needs for an infant, consider a 2-month old infant \nweighing 9.57 pounds (4.35 kg):\n\u2022\t 4.35 \u00d7 90\u2013100 kcal range = 391.5\u2013435 kcal \n\u00adrequired per day.\n\u2022\t 391 \u00f7 20 = 19.6 ounces of formula needed per \nday. Thus, if the child eats every 4 hours, she would \n\u00adrequire 3\u20134 ounces of formula per feeding.\n\u2022\t 435 \u00f7 20 = 21.75 ounces of formula needed per \nday. Thus, if the child eats every 4 hours, she would \nrequire 3.6 ounces of formula per feeding.\nNote that these calculations are averages. Each child has \nits own unique feeding habits.\nFluid Bolus Calculation\nTo rapidly replace intravascular fluid deficits, the pediatric \nnurse calculates the quantity of sterile crystalloid IV solu\u00ad\ntion to administer. The calculation assumes 20 mL of IV \nfluid is needed for each kilogram of weight. For instance, \nif a toddler is seen in the pediatric oncology clinic with \nmucositis from chemotherapy and presents with tachycardia, \nno tears, and dry mucous membranes, the pediatric nurse \nshould expect to receive orders for IV fluid boluses of 0.9% \nnormal saline (NS). For a toddler weighing 28 pounds, \nthe following example demonstrates the bolus calculation:\n28 lb = 12.73 kg\n12.73 \u00d7 20 mL = 255 mL of IV fluid per bolus\nIf the child\u2019s vital signs are not what might be expected \ngiven the child\u2019s age, the nurse can expect to give more \nthan one bolus. Take vital signs and conduct an assess\u00ad\nment between each bolus. Report when urine output has \nbeen restored.\nBEST PRACTICES\nC\nhildren who are tethered to lines, tubes, and electrical \nequipment require frequent assessments. Older infants \nand toddlers have died from unintentional strangulation \nby medical equipment used in hospital cribs. Always try to \nguide tubes away from a child\u2019s line of vision (e.g., by securely \ntaping central line tubing or nasogastric tubing away from \nthe child\u2019s visual field and extending down the child\u2019s back).\nWhenever performing skills on a child that require the \nplacement of tubes or lines, communicate their presence to \nmembers of the healthcare team by labeling the line. Write \nyour initials, the date, and the time of insertion, and securely \nwrap the label around the line away from the child\u2019s reach.

An ANC of less than 500 cells/\nmcL requires implementation of neutropenic precautions. \nA complete blood cell count (CBC) with differentiation of \nthe various white blood cells (WBC) is required to calculate \nthe ANC. The calculation to determine ANC is as follows:\n1.\t Add the segmented neutrophils (mature) to the \nband neutrophils (immature) as a total percentage.\n2.\t Multiply the percentage of neutrophils by the total \nWBC count.\nExample:\nWBC = 1400\nSegmented neutrophils = 13%\nBand neutrophils = 3%\nAdd 0.13 + 0.03 = 0.16\n0.16 \u00d7 1400 = ANC = 224 cells/mcL (very low \n\u00adfinding\u2014requires neutropenic precautions)\nmore vulnerable, they are given doses of blood transfusions. \nPacked red blood cells (PRBC) is the most commonly \nadministered blood product.

This removal allows for expansion of the \nchild\u2019s lungs and restores the required negative pressure \nneeded in the child\u2019s thoracic cavity for breathing and ven\u00ad\ntilation. Chest tubes are placed in the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), \nand emergency department (ED). When needed, they can \nbe placed on the pediatric hospital unit, preferably in the \npediatric treatment room, rather than in the child\u2019s bed.\nChest tube drainage systems in pediatrics have the \nsame components as the systems used in adults: three \nchambers of water seal, suction control, and collection and \nmeasurement of drainage.

For \ninstance, amoxicillin, an oral medication often given for \ninfectious processes such as bacterial otitis media, has the \nfollowing safe dose range for mild to moderate ear, nose, and \nthroat infections (GlaxoSmithKline, 2006; Medscape, 2016):\n\u2022\t Birth to 3 months: \u2264 30 mg/kg/day PO divided ev\u00ad\nery 12 hours for 48\u201372 hours; to be given \nfor \u2265 10 days\n\u2022\t 3 months and weight up to 40 kg: 20\u201340 mg/kg/day, \ndivided into 3 doses every 8 hours; 25\u201345 mg/kg/\nday PO divided every 12 hours\n\u2022\t Weight greater than 40 kg: 500 mg PO every \n12\u00a0hours or 250 mg PO every 8 hours for \n10\u201314 days, up to 875 mg every 12 hours\nDetermining the Volume to Draw from the Available \nPackaging\nAfter confirming the accuracy of the received medication \norder, double-checking the mg/kg dose, and determining \nthe safe dose range, the pediatric nurse next determines \nthe process and quantity of drawing up the medication. For \ninstance, suppose the nurse receives an order for 22 mg of \nmethylprednisolone. This dose is confirmed to be safe for \nthe child\u2019s weight and the dose falls within the safe dose \nrange. The nurse, upon opening an electronic medication \ndispensing machine, notes that the medication comes as a \npowder in a vial. The instructions state to push the sterile \nfluid attached to the vial into the medication to produce \n40 mg of methylprednisolone for 1 mL of sterile fluid. The \nnurse then calculates the safe quantity to draw up out of \nthe vial. In this example, the total amount that should be \ndrawn up is 0.55 mL.\nIntramuscular, Subcutaneous, and Intradermal \nInjections\nWhen oral or other options are available for administering \nmedications, injections may be avoided in children. When an \ninjection or IV is required, however, pain control is essential \nto minimize children\u2019s distress. For routine intramuscular or \nsubcutaneous injections, such as immunizations, distraction \nor use of a vibrating pain-reducing device such as the Buzzy \nis appropriate, or a rapid-acting (but short-lived) topical \nspray anesthetic such as Pain Ease can be used. For blood \ndraws, infusions, IV placement, or any other procedure that \nrequires insertion of a needle or cannula through the skin, \nit is appropriate to use 4% lidocaine cream or EMLA, which \ntake longer to reach full effect but provide a longer-lasting \nand deeper anesthetic response.

Children are vulnerable to such errors, and families \nneed astute professional guidance on proper medication \nadministration, safe storage, and accurate dosing.\nPHARMACOLOGY \nI\nf the medication dose ordered by the physician falls outside \nthe range calculated as safe for that child based on the \nchild\u2019s age and weight (see the \u201cSafe Dose Range\u201d section), the \ndose should not be administered. Instead, the nurse should \ncall the pharmacist on duty to confirm the order\u2019s safety and \nreport the discrepancy between the ordered dose and the \nsafe dose;\u00a0the nurse should then call the primary physician \nwho wrote the order to question and clarify it. Use the SBAR \n(situation, background, assessment, and recommendation) \nprotocol to ensure professional communication when clarify\u00ad\ning pediatric medication dosing.\nInfants and young children are particularly susceptible \nto adverse consequences of medication errors in which a \nlarger-than-recommended dose is administered due to the \nfollowing differences in their pharmacodynamics (absorption), \npharmacokinetics (distribution), and drug excretion:\n\u2022\t Their immature liver leads to slower drug metabolism \nand longer drug exposure.\n\u2022\t Medications rapidly cross their blood\u2013brain barrier.\n\u2022\t Their immature kidney function leads to delayed drug \nexcretion.\nCalculating Medication Doses Based on Weight\nSafe doses of medications for children, regardless of the \nadministration route, are calculated in terms of milligrams \nof medication per kilogram of weight. It is important to have \na recent and accurate weight of a child to ascertain that the \nmedication to be administered is safe for the specific child. \nMost medications are dispensed in either unit doses, multiple \ndoses, or prefilled cups, syringes, or IV bags. Double-check \nthat the medication dose in the prefilled syringe, cup, or IV \nbag is within the safe dose range for the child.

The patch tends to be more useful in \nminor procedures because of the limited area of coverage it \nprovides. The cream can also be used for smaller areas (e.g., \nan injection site) if taped to the location with an occlusive \ndressing such as Tegaderm, which improves absorption in \nthe site. Numbing of the skin occurs in approximately 45 to \n60 minutes, and lasts an hour or two after the medication is \nwiped from the skin, although a shorter duration of effect may \noccur in more vascular areas. Blanching or reddening of the \nskin may occur but is harmless.

The movement of fluids across membranes \nis due to osmotic forces of the fluids.

This line, which provides easy access \nwithout requiring multiple venous access sticks (i.e., \ninsertion of a needle into a vein), assures that the child \nis more comfortable. Having readily available access also \nincreases safety during emergencies such as treatment of \nFigure 27-10\u2002 Three types of central lines: PICC line, implanted port, \ntunneled catheter.\nTip of catheter\ntubing in large\nvein near heart\nPower loc safety\ninfusion set\nPalpation \npoints\nIncision to \ninsert catheter\nCatheter tubing\nunder the skin\nExit site\nPICC line \nenters\nbody here\nPICC\nPICC\nImplanted port \nTunneled catheter\nHeart\nAccess port\nPower port\nCatheter\nBlood \nvessel\n400\t\nChapter 27\u2003 Essential Skills for Pediatric Nursing\n", "alone, with specific syringe pump tubing being directly at\u00ad\ntached to the child\u2019s peripheral or central venous catheter, \nor they can be inserted (Y-ed) into a child\u2019s existing IV line. \nIn new syringe pump technology, medication dosing is \ndetermined by preset safety calculation programs based on \nthe child\u2019s weight. If a pediatric nurse mistakenly programs \nthe syringe pump to administer a specific medication at \nan unsafe rate (too rapidly), the syringe pump technology \nwill alarm and display a caution message.\nPatient-Controlled Analgesia in \nPediatrics\nChildren in acute or chronic pain may benefit from the use \nof patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). With this type of \ntherapy, the IV PCA pump is programmed to deliver opioid \nmedication either at a continuous (basal) rate or a dose \ndetermined by the patient\u2019s control of the administration \nbutton; alternatively, it may accommodate both types of \ndoses. Although PCA is most commonly used in school-age \nor older patients, some children as young as 4 years have \nlearned to use PCA appropriately. Children\u2019s ability to use \na PCA machine is influenced by their developmental level, \nage, and health condition.\nThe PCA machine (Figure 27-12) provides four basic \ncomponents of a medication order: the medication to be \nadministered (morphine, hydromorphone); the quantity to \nbe delivered per dose; the quantity to be delivered throughout \neach hour (basal rate); and the total maximum dose allowed \nin a period of time (from 1 hour up to a 4-hour maximum, \ndepending on the pump guidelines). Safety is maintained in \nchildren as long as the safe dose is accurately ordered for the \nchild\u2019s weight and needs. Neither the parent nor the nurse \nshould press the button to deliver the medication except \nunder special conditions, such as an impending painful \nprocedure where extra medication is required beyond the \na high fever with rapidly administered antibiotics and \nwith fluids administration in a child with cancer who \nis immunocompromised.

Scalp veins can be used for this purpose, but must be \nprotected with devices to prevent dislodgment. Foot veins \nin standing and walking children should be avoided. Use of \nIV protection, such as pediatric \u201cno-no\u201d arm restraints, is \nrecommended to avoid accidental dislodgment of the site.\nSyringe Pumps\nSyringe pumps\u2014a type of small infusion pump\u2014are often \nused in the care of children (Figure 27-11). For premature \ninfants, neonates, infants, and young children, syringe \npump infusions allow for the safest minimal volumes to be \ninfused via an IV pump system that holds syringes rather \nthan IV fluid bags. The smallest syringe accepted by most \nsyringe pumps is 3 mL, and the largest is 60 mL.\nSyringe pumps provide for control of volume and rate \nof infusion, along with safety alarms indicating increasing \npressure caused by occlusion. These devices can be used \nFigure 27-11\u2002 A syringe pump.\n\u00a9 beerkoff/Shutterstock\nFigure 27-12\u2002 A PCA machine.\nAgencja Fotograficzna Caro/Alamy Stock Photo\n\t\nPatient-Controlled Analgesia in Pediatrics\t\n401\n", "provision of the PCA dose order.

No electrocardiogram \n(EKG) strip is produced; rather, the machine allows for a \nwarning alarm to be emitted in case of an abnormally low \nor high respiratory rate or heart rate, and in the presence of \napnea (typically 15 to 20 seconds without a breath). High \nand low respiratory and heart rate values are programmed \ninto the machine, as well as the criteria for a period of \napnea. The pediatric nurse places two electrodes on the \nchild\u2019s chest and secures the electrodes with adhesive \nmaterial; in home apnea monitors, the electrodes may be \nsecured by soft straps. Alcohol should be used to clean \nthe child\u2019s skin oils where the electrodes will be placed to \nensure better adherence.\nSpecimen Collection\nUrine\nUrinalysis specimen collection can be done by the \u201cclean \ncatch\u201d method for older children who can control their \nstream of urine, cotton ball placement in a child\u2019s diaper, \nor the application of a urinary collection bag.

Use of pain relief aids such as numbing cream \n(EMLA) or spray (Pain Ease), distraction, and use of the \nBuzzy can help minimize the discomfort associated with \nneedle sticks.\nNewborns, infants, and toddlers should have minimal \nblood volumes taken for laboratory analysis. Micro-containers \n(Figure 27-15) are appropriate in most blood collection \nrequirements. Check with the laboratory personnel to \ndetermine the smallest quantity of blood required.\n402\t\nChapter 27\u2003 Essential Skills for Pediatric Nursing\n", "Hearing Acuity Assessment\nEvery state mandates when and how young children \nhave their hearing assessed via the Early Hearing Detec\u00ad\ntion and Intervention (EHDI) program. The purpose of \nthis nationwide program is to detect significant hearing \nloss before a child reaches 3 months of age. Many states \nmandate newborn hearing screening. Hearing acuity is \ndirectly related to a child\u2019s academic success and language \ndevelopment, so accurate hearing assessment is an im\u00ad\nperative. Children of any age can accurately have their \nhearing screened.\nNewborns and Infants\nHearing screening is performed using technology that \nevokes otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). The OAE machine \nproduces a stimuli sound through the ear canal via a probe \nthat sends and records the sound. The newborn\u2019s or infant\u2019s \near response (an echo-type response naturally produced \nin response to sound) is captured. This process is safe and \npain free. Many infants sleep right through the screening, \nand it takes just a few minutes to complete.\nAnother device used in newborns and infants measures \nthe auditory brain stem response (ABR). This device \ncaptures how well sound travels along the hearing nerve \nto the brain. Electrodes are placed on the infant\u2019s head \nand behind the ear, sound is directed via earphones, and \nthe electrodes record how the brain responds to differ\u00ad\nent sounds. This procedure takes approximately 30 to \n60 minutes.\nToddlers\nHearing assessment in the toddler period is done in several \nways. For example, in play audiometry (PA), children are \ntaught how to wait, listen, and then perform a play activ\u00ad\nity whenever they hear a specific sound. Another simpler \nmethod relies on visual reinforcement orientation audiom\u00ad\netry (VROA), in which a child\u2019s hearing is grossly tested by \nproviding sounds in various frequencies during play and \nthe child\u2019s response by turning toward the speaker is noted.\nPreschoolers\nA well-calibrated pure tone audiometry machine is used \nto assess hearing in cooperative preschool-age children. \nEarphones are placed on the child and sounds are used to \ndetect hearing. The child must raise the hand in response \nto hearing the sound provided. Use of this technology \nrequires a quiet environment.\nAssessment Tips\nDue to children\u2019s unique anatomy, the pediatric nurse uses \nskills for assessment that are appropriate for the child\u2019s age, \nsize, and developmental ability.\nEar Examination\nGiven the high incidence of otitis media with and without \neffusions in pediatric patients, children\u2019s ears are frequently \ninspected. Otoscopes and disposable ear pieces are readily \nfound in pediatric healthcare settings. The pediatric nurse \nmust be skilled at inspecting a child\u2019s outer ear and middle \near for the presence of foreign bodies, obstructing ceru\u00ad\nmen, inflammation, and infection. The nurse gently inserts \nthe otoscope to visualize the ear canal and the tympanic \nmembrane. The tympanic membrane should be intact with \na pink color. If it is found to be red, inflamed, perforated, or \ndraining pus or fluids, then infection should be suspected. \nTo best visualize the tympanic membrane of children, the \nnurse pulls the ear pinna down and back for children age \n3 years and younger, and up and back for children older \nthan 3 years of age.\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nY\noung children can be very resistant and frightened of an \notoscope and the inspection of their middle ear. By being \nplayful and asking if the nurse can look for elephants in their \near, young children can be distracted momentarily. If the child \nis uncooperative, the nurse can place the child in the lap of \nthe parent; the parent then holds the child\u2019s head with one \nhand against his or her chest, while restraining the child\u2019s \narms with the other arm across the child\u2019s chest.\nVisual Acuity Screening\nA child\u2019s vision is assessed according to the child\u2019s age. \nInfants\u2019 visual acuity is not assessed beyond their ability to \ntrack an object with their eyes. For toddlers, visual acuity \nis assessed by the HOTV instrument, Snellen E chart, or \na picture chart. The HOTV instrument uses only the let\u00ad\nters H, O, T and V in a random order, as the toddler may \nnot know the alphabet. A separate card with the HOTV \nletters can be held close by so that the child can point \nout what he or she sees on the chart 20 feet away. Older \nchildren who have mastered the alphabet will typically use \nthe Snellen chart.\n\t\nAssessment Tips\t\n403\n", "Chapter Summary\n\u25c6\u25c6Children of all ages and developmental levels experience \nthe need for nursing skills and procedures.

Professional guidelines, \nlaws, regulations of practice, practice alerts, and licensure \nmandates need to be understood for the specific state(s) \nin which the nurse practices. The nurse provides care for \nsick and vulnerable populations, groups, and individuals. \nEach state\u00a0views these responsibilities as a social contract \nwith the public, whose members need protection in the \nhealthcare environment. If the social contract is breached \nor broken, the state board is legally responsible for enforc\u00ad\ning disciplinary action to protect the public.\nIntroduction\nThe professional practice of nursing and the care of those \nin need have many legal aspects to consider. Nurses need \nto understand how their professional practice is regulated. \nThe National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), \nalong with each state\u2019s Board of Registered Nursing and its \nnurse practice act, provides oversight, regulation, and au\u00ad\nthority over licensure and practice of nursing. Safe practice \nstems from a solid understanding of hazards, implications, \nand responsibilities associated with licensed professional \npractice, scope of practice, and nurse practice acts. Legally \nsafe practice requires knowledge of responsibilities, scope \nof practice, and legal risks associated with the practice of \nnursing.\nNurse Practice Acts\nThe practice of nursing has developed into a highly skilled \nprofession that requires independent decision making, \na specialized body of knowledge, and delivery of care \nthat minimizes risks of harm. Because of the complexity \nsurrounding care in multiple settings and with diverse \npopulations, oversight is needed to ensure nursing care is \nprovided by competent, prepared, and responsible people. \nNurse practice acts (NPAs) provide the nursing profession \nwith guidelines on nursing practice and governance on \nperformance; these acts are set forth by state governments to \nprotect the public. State legislation provides NPAs through \nboth laws and boards of nursing that implement rules and \nregulations for safety. Each state\u2019s Board of Registered \nNursing holds the power and authority to license nurses, \nregulate their education, and provide disciplinary action \nand remedies for nurses who fail to meet the profession\u2019s \nstandards. Practice within the profession of nursing is not \na right, but rather a protected professional act that is highly \nregulated at the state level. Even so, state boards of nurs\u00ad\ning are in a position to serve as advocates for healthcare \nconsumers as well as advocates for nurses.\nScope of Practice\nThe scope of practice defines the limits of nurses\u2019 legal, \nethical, and moral practice boundaries. A registered nurse \n(RN) must first complete an accredited program of study, \nsit for and pass the NCSBN\u2019s National Council Licensure \nExaminations (NCLEX exams), and meet requirements for \ncontinued good standing in practice. One aspect of good \nstanding is that the pediatric nurse provides care within \nthe scope of practice for a licensed RN and maintains the \nmandates associated with continued licensure. According \nto Brous (2012), maintaining a good standing requires \ndemonstrating a moral character, continuing education, \nFigure 28-1\u2002 A nurse must practice within the scope of RN licensure \nwithin the nurse\u2019s state.\n\u00a9 Brian Eichhorn/Shutterstock\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nI\ns a person\u2019s private life and conduct relevant to his or her \nprofessional nursing practice and licensure?

Nursing is a complex professional \npractice that requires application of the nursing process, \neducational theory, developmental theory, leadership \ntheory, and management theory, as well as the promotion, \nrestoration, and maintenance of health. The nurse must \nbe prepared to care for clients or patients in a variety of \nclinical settings\u2014hospitals, community settings, business \nsettings, and educational settings. This is no small feat. Not \nsurprisingly, then, the educational preparation of a profes\u00ad\nsional nurse for clinical practice is rigorous, demanding, \nand complex. The nurse must be prepared to make sound \nclinical judgments independently but also within complex \ninterdisciplinary teams.\nPracticing as a nurse requires accountability, compassion, \nand highly specialized knowledge, often with a particular \npopulation. To best prepare for practice in pediatric nurs\u00ad\ning, the nurse must understand the needs of patients across \nthe developmental period stretching from prematurity \nthrough young adulthood, and be prepared to assist these \npatients within the context of a family. Maintaining clinical \ncompetency, currency in knowledge and theory, application \nof technological skills, and currency in licensure are all \nrequirements of state boards of nursing.\nLicensure\nObtaining an RN license requires that the nurse gradu\u00ad\nate from an accredited program and pass the NCLEX, a \nnational licensing examination created, validated, and \nimplemented by the National Council of State Boards \nof Nursing. All states have had a licensure examina\u00ad\ntion since 1923, albeit with wide variations in those \nexaminations. Today, the NCLEX is administered via \ncomputerized adaptive technology (CAT), with each \nexaminee being given a different examination and the \nnumber of questions ranging from 75 to 260 depend\u00ad\ning on test performance. The computer adapts to the \nperformance of the licensure candidate during the test \nprocedure until the examinee demonstrates competency \nequivalent to the performance of a nurse in entry-level \npractice (Figure 28-2).\nStates have their own particular requirements concern\u00ad\ning background checks, felony and criminal disclosures, \nand fingerprinting as part of the licensure process. Having \na history of a felony, fraudulent practice, or violation of \ncertain laws pertaining to crimes may require disciplinary \naction or investigations prior to being cleared for licensure. \nParticipation in \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d as defined by a \nstate\u2019s Board of Registered Nursing, may be grounds for \nrevoking a professional license. Examples of unprofessional \nconduct include diverting drugs or narcotics from patients \nfor personal use by the nurse; engaging in the distribu\u00ad\ntion, sale, or possession of illegal substances or controlled \nsubstances without legitimate cause; failure to meet mini\u00ad\nmal standards of nursing practice; inaccurate recording; \nleaving a nursing assignment; discriminating against or \nFigure 28-2\u2002 Nurses must graduate from an accedited program and \npass the NCLEX in order to obtain RN licensure in the United States.\n\u00a9 alejandrophotography/E+/Getty Images\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\u2002 (continued)\nintoxicated, driving under the influence, lapse of current \nlicensure (practicing with an expired license), failure to \nmeet continued education requirements, and dishonesty \nwhen applying for an initial license or for a continuation \nof licensure can have significant consequences. Online \nbehavior on social networking sites is creating new ethical \ndilemmas in the profession as well (Levati, 2014). Most state \nboards of nursing can require (or compel, as described by \nsome states) a nurse to undergo drug testing to determine \nwhether continuation of safe practice is being upheld. In \nsome states, whether a nurse paid taxes, made child support \nand alimony payments, and satisfied creditors can influence \nthe continuation of an RN licensure.\n408\t\nChapter 28\u2003 Safe and Legal Aspects of\u00a0Care\n", "Organizations of Professional \nOversight\nThe main focus of regulatory bodies is ensuring the \nsafety of healthcare consumers. State, national, and \ninternational boards or councils of nursing contribute \nto that safety by providing licensure oversight, data \ncollection on licensed nurses, data collection on nurs\u00ad\ning practice, and disciplinary actions, including loss \nof license and support of criminal investigations, as \nneeded. Several bodies provide professional oversight \nover the attainment and continuation of licensure for \nregistered nursing, including organizations that provide \nstate-based oversight, manage national licensure, and \nestablish international codes of ethics and international \npractice guidelines.\nState Boards of Registered Nursing\nState Boards of Registered Nursing (BRNs) provide \nconsumers with protection from harm. By providing \nlicensure oversight via the Department of Consumer \nAffairs, the BRN implements laws that regulate nursing \npractice and provide authority to enforce disciplinary \nactions. State BRNs have an eclectic membership; they \ninclude both professional nurses and elected community \nmembers with no licensure or healthcare services back\u00ad\nground. Members serve on the board and have the direct \nresponsibility of protecting consumers of nursing care. \nNurses who serve on the BRN must be actively engaged \nin professional practice.\nNational Council of State Boards of Nursing\nThe NCSBN is a regulatory organization that encompasses \nthe various state boards of nursing. The first, overarching \naim of the NCSBN is to protect the public\u2019s welfare and \nhealth by \u201cassuring that safe and competent nursing care \nis provided by licensed nurses\u201d (NCSBN, 2017). Oversight \nof the registered nurse\u2019s licensure is provided by grant\u00ad\ning a nurse legal permission to practice safely within a \nnarrow scope of practice. The four areas that the NCSBN \nmanages are standards relating to education, licensure, \npractice, and discipline. Outlining and communicating \nstandards for safe nursing care is the second major aim \nof the NCSBN.\nInternational Council of Nurses\nThe International Council of Nurses (ICN) is a fed\u00ad\neration consisting of 130 national nurse associations that \ncollectively represent more than 16 million nurses world\u00ad\nwide. This organization\u2019s mission is to provide practice \nstandards, global health policies, scientific advancement, \nand leadership by representing nursing on a worldwide \nbullying others; failing to perform in a way that meets \nminimal standards; and being deemed unsafe or fabricating \ninformation to obtain or maintain a professional license \n(Becher & Visovsky, 2012; Blair, Kable, Courtney-Pratt, & \nDoran, 2015; MacLean, Coombs, & Breda, 2016; Olson & \nStokes, 2016). See the individual state\u2019s nurse practice act \nfor further information.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nUnprofessional Conduct\nAlthough variations exist from state to state, examples of \nunprofessional conduct in nursing include the following \ntransgressions:\n\u2022\t Inaccurate documentation or fabricated vital signs\n\u2022\t Failure to perform per common and expected \nstandards\n\u2022\t Leaving a nursing assignment without notification of \na supervisor\n\u2022\t False reporting of continuing education documenta\u00ad\ntion to a state board of nursing\n\u2022\t Practicing nursing without a current license\n\u2022\t Testing positive for illegal substances\nBEST PRACTICES\nWorking with Student Nurses\nA common misperception is that the licensed pediatric RN \nworking with nursing students is legally responsible for the \ncare provided by those students. In fact, the RN assigned to \na child\u2019s care is legally responsible for caring for the child \nand practicing within his or her scope of practice. The nurse \nwho is ultimately responsible for the child is the nurse who is \nassigned to the patient and who is working as an employed \nlicensed professional.\nStudent nurses are working as students and require su\u00ad\npervision. The actions carried out by students have specific \nlimits; that is, students must not perform any skill, duty, \ntechnology, or assessment that they have not been taught \nand for which their competency has not been evaluated. \nStudents spend most of their time in the observation role. \nWhen care is provided by a nursing student, the student \nmust limit the actions to those defined by the student\u2019s \nnovice unlicensed role.\nSchools of nursing are responsible for providing their \nstudents with malpractice insurance. There should be a close \nassociation between the student\u2019s nursing faculty member \n(clinical) and the RN assigned to the pediatric patient to \nensure communication about limits on the student\u2019s role, \nskills, and performance.\n\t\nOrganizations of Professional Oversight\t\n409\n", "Malpractice\nTo avoid malpractice claims, pediatric nurses must perform \ntheir professional duties at the level expected given their \nresponsibilities and licensure. Ensuring that documentation \nis meticulous, accurate, and thorough is a key consideration \nin preventing malpractice lawsuits. Thorough assessments, \naccurate skills, articulate communication, and attention \nto detail to prevent errors are all part of safe and legal \npractice. Even if it seems mundane, the pediatric nurse \nmust document daily routine care that represents protec\u00ad\ntion from harm and promotion of health and wellbeing. \nWritten proof of the nurse\u2019s care\u2014which should be based \non standards, policies, and procedures\u2014via paper or \nelectronic charting consistently offers the best protection \nagainst malpractice lawsuits.\nFour conditions must be met if a malpractice claim is \nto succeed:\n\u2022\t A duty between a patient and a nurse was owed.\n\u2022\t The nurse did not perform that duty or violated \nthat duty.\n\u2022\t Injuries were caused by the failure of a nurse to act \non his or her duties.\nbasis. ICN (2015) categorizes its work into three areas: \n(1) activities that promote the practice of professional \nnursing, (2)\u00a0activities that assist in the regulation of the \nprofession, and (3) activities that promote the socioeco\u00ad\nnomic welfare of the professional nursing global workforce.\nIn 2000, ICN established an international code of ethics \nfor nurses. This work was organized into four elements:\n\u2022\t Nurses and people: values, rights, confidentiality, \nand respect\n\u2022\t Nurses and practice: responsibility, education, \nevidence-based practice, and safety\n\u2022\t Nurses and coworkers: teamwork, cooperation, and \ninterdisciplinary care\n\u2022\t Nurses and the profession: currency in practice, stan\u00ad\ndards of practice, scope of practice, and knowledge\nOther Organizations\nOther organizations that provide oversight of nurses\u2019 \nprofessional practice include State Departments of Health \nand Human Services and The Joint Commission. They \nprovide standards for safe care in healthcare institutions \nas well as oversight, investigations, and site visits related \nto the practice of nursing.\nTort Law\nA tort is a wrongful act that produces harm to a patient, \nwhether that harm was intentional or unintentional. Tort \nlaw is the legal aspect of patient care that involves negligence \n(omitting care) or malpractice (performing a harmful act), \nwith the goal of promoting safer behavior (Zabinski & Black, \n2015). Most nurses understand the term malpractice as it \npertains to an act where specific standards of care were \nnot performed or fully met.\nPrevention of Negligence\nThe term negligence is used to describe a breach or \nfailure in behaving in a reasonable and prudent manner. \nPrevention of negligence in nursing means that the nurse \nperforms his or her duties within the scope of practice \nusing reasonable and prudent judgment and decision \nmaking (Figure 28-3). A claim of negligence indicates \nthat the nurse failed to practice in such a way that another \nperson, in a similar situation, would identify the actions \nas neither reasonable nor prudent. Examples of negli\u00ad\ngence in nursing include failure to provide proper and \nsafe monitoring of recent postoperative patients; failure \nto provide for the safety of infants by not having suction, \noxygen, and resuscitation equipment readily available; and \nadministering an inaccurate dose of insulin to a diabetic \nchild (not double-checking doses with a second RN).\nFigure 28-3\u2002 Prevention of negligence in nursing means that the \nnurse performs his or her duties within the scope of practice using \nreasonable and prudent judgment and decision making.\n\u00a9 Blend Images - Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Brand X Pictures/Getty\n410\t\nChapter 28\u2003 Safe and Legal Aspects of\u00a0Care\n", "confused about the care needed by their child. Parental \nrefusal of medical care is a complex phenomenon and \ncan be due to stress, religious beliefs, cultural perspec\u00ad\ntives, or lack of education. Children are vulnerable to \nparental influences in treatment refusal. Any suspicion of \nrefusal\u2014whether it involves limiting medical care, refusing \nmedical care, or failing to adhere to a medical or nursing \ntreatment plan\u2014must be reported to the administrative \nand medical teams.\nFloating Outside the Nurse\u2019s Usual Unit \nor Care Setting\nSituations in which staffing influences where a pediatric \nnurse practices can have safety and legal consequences. \nWhen pediatric nurses are required to float to care areas \nother than pediatric settings, their clinical competencies \nin regard to theory, assessments, care practices, skills, \nand documentation must be confirmed. For instance, if \na pediatric nurse is required to float to an intensive care \nenvironment, the nurse must have documented compe\u00ad\ntencies prior to providing care. The same is true when an \nadult nurse floats to a pediatric care environment. Without \ndocumented competencies, nurses should not be asked to \nprovide care to children.\nChildren on a Police Hold\nAn uncomfortable but not infrequent situation that occurs \nin pediatric health care is the need for a child to be placed \non a police hold. In this scenario, the child is deemed to \nneed extra protection, even within the hospital setting. \nCases of child maltreatment may warrant a police hold, \nwhich may ban or limit a parent\u2019s visiting rights. The \npediatric nurse caring for a child on a police hold must \nobtain sufficient information to participate in the child\u2019s \nprotection.\nChildren with Developmental or \nCognitive Disabilities\nChildren who are not at the developmental or cogni\u00ad\ntive level usually associated with their chronological \nage bring further complexities in care. The nurse must \nrealize that these children may not understand what \nis occurring to and around them, and they may not \nbe able to participate in their care if they function at a \nlower level than their same-age peers. For instance, a \n10-year-old developmentally delayed child may not be \nable to comprehend his environment, take medications \non cue, or participate in personal hygiene, and may pose \ngreater threats to safety and increased chances of bodily \nharm.\n\u2022\t Actual and measurable injury or harm occurred \ndue to the failure of the nurse to meet the standards \nof care or duty.\nIt is far more common for a nurse to become drawn \ninto a civil lawsuit than a criminal lawsuit. Civil lawsuits \nencompass situations where a patient and family feel \ntheir individual rights were infringed upon or violated by \na nurse or healthcare team. The family, which is consid\u00ad\nered the plaintiff, has the responsibility of providing the \nburden of proof of wrongdoing or violation by the nurse \n(the defendant).\nUnique Issues of Safety in \nPediatric\u00a0Nursing Practice\nThe care of children entails unique care practices and \ncompetencies not found in the care of adults. To be suc\u00ad\ncessful in the complex care of children and their families, \na pediatric nurse needs to obtain sufficient preparation, to \npractice role modeling and support, and to secure strong \nadministrative guidance. The presence of vulnerable children \nin a clinical setting requires a special view of care. Wise \npediatric nurses will want to review the following aspects \nthat are unique to providing comprehensive and holistic \ncare to children in any clinical setting.\nHospitalized Children Without Parents \nor Guardians Present\nA child who is hospitalized without having a supportive \nfamily member present places the nurse in a situation of \nneeding to provide greater supervision, as such a child is \nvulnerable to both emotional turmoil and physical risk. \nWhen possible, encourage family to stay with a hospitalized \nchild, no matter what the child\u2019s age. Provide a sleeping \narrangement in close proximity to the child.\nChild Maltreatment Reports\nThe number of child maltreatment cases that are reported \nto child protection agencies is only the tip of the iceberg\u2014it \nfalls far short of indicating just how prevalent child mal\u00ad\ntreatment is on a global scale. The most common form of \nmaltreatment in the United States is neglect. Regardless \nof the type or form of maltreatment, the pediatric nurse \nis responsible for identifying, reporting, and preventing \nfurther child maltreatment.\nParental or Guardian Refusal of Medical Treatments\nGiven the emotional turmoil that arises when a child is \nill or injured, parents may become frustrated, angry, or \n\t\nUnique Issues of Safety in Pediatric\u00a0Nursing Practice\t\n411\n", "provide that care, and has sufficient competence \nand understanding to do so. Delegate tasks only \nto those persons who have the appropriate legal \ncapacity, educational preparation, and licensure or \ncertification. For instance, do not delegate complex \ncare or advanced assessments to a licensed voca\u00ad\ntional nurse. Ask nursing assistants to perform \nonly those duties in which they have demonstrated \ncompetence. For further guidelines, see the NCSBN \n(2005) position paper on working with others and \ndelegating.\n\u2022\t Applying principles of legal and safe charting. The \nnational movement toward electronic medical \n\u00adrecords (EMR) is under way, with federal mandates \ndictating the need for any healthcare institution \nthat accepts federal funds to have an EMR system \nin place. Regardless of the form of charting re\u00ad\nquired, it is imperative that charting on each child \nbe complete and follow institutional requirements \nas well as state and federal mandates.\n\u2022\t Preventing errors in pediatric healthcare treatment \nsettings to save lives and prevent injuries and harm. \nThe pediatric nurse is safety minded in all clinical \nsettings and in all clinical circumstances. Demon\u00ad\nstrating safety mindedness includes conducting \nsafety sweeps using all of one\u2019s senses and mak\u00ad\ning the assumption that children are, in general, \ninherently unsafe and require supervision when \nreceiving care in healthcare settings. Consistently \ninsisting that children wear accurate identification \ntags with their name, birth date, and medical record \nidentifier allows the nurse to conduct safety checks \nbefore initiating nursing care, medication admin\u00ad\nistration, and medical procedures. Parents or legal \nguardians must also wear identification badges or \nbracelets.\n\u2022\t Documenting incident reports to share high-error \nsituations and the need for changes to improve safety. \nWhen an error occurs, or nearly occurs (near miss), \nthe pediatric nurse should communicate what hap\u00ad\npened via an incident report and submit that report \nto administrative personnel. This allows for an in\u00ad\nvestigation of what occurred prior to, during, and \nafter an error. Without documentation of error or \nnear miss circumstances, changes cannot be made \nto prevent future errors. Application of the prin\u00ad\nciples of a just culture supports a nurse in reporting \nerrors or near misses without fear of reprimand or \nreprisal.\n\u2022\t Understanding institutional compliance, including \nbeing well versed in institutional policies and proce\u00ad\ndures. Because many aspects of caring for children \ndiffer from caring for patients at other developmen\u00ad\ntal stages, it is important that the pediatric nurse \nFAMILY EDUCATION\nInformed Consent\nChildren are not legally able to provide informed consent \n(i.e., permission to initiate a healthcare intervention), but \nchildren who are developmentally capable from the age of \nseven years should be included in assent. Assent means that \nthe child is included in the discussions of health care, treat\u00ad\nment decisions, and priorities.\nBecause children cannot provide informed consent, \nit is imperative that the pediatric nurse participate in \nmeeting the legal and ethical requirements for obtaining \ninformed consent from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) \non the child\u2019s behalf. Issues to be discussed during the \ninformed consent process include the procedure, who will \nbe performing the procedure, the nature of the procedure, \nits risks, its benefits, and any alternatives. The discussion \nshould be expanded to include the potential outcomes or \nprognosis if the procedure is not performed or is delayed. \nThree signatures are often required on the informed con\u00ad\nsent form: the signature of the physician or primary care \nprovider (physician assistant or nurse practitioner) who is \nresponsible for the implementation of the procedure; the \nsignature of the child\u2019s parent or legal guardian; and the \nsignature of the witness, who is often the nurse. (For safety \nand accuracy, check your state regulations on legal consent \nprocedure requirements.)\nTips for Achieving a Successful \nCareer\u00a0as a Pediatric Nurse\nPediatric nurses should continue to be informed about \nspecific aspects of safe and legally appropriate nursing \npractice. Among other topics, the pediatric nurse should \nbe well versed in the following issues:\n\u2022\t Knowing one\u2019s scope of practice as it pertains to the \nregistered nurse caring for children from prematurity \nthrough adolescence. Understand that the core of \npediatric nursing is the care of not just the child, \nbut the entire family. (See the Society of Pediatric \nNurses website at http://www.pedsnurses.org.)\n\u2022\t Knowing delegation parameters for the role of the \npediatric nurse. Appropriate and safe delegation \nstems from the pediatric nurse understanding how \nto assign, manage, and supervise other healthcare \nproviders such as nursing assistive personnel. As\u00ad\nsuring competence prior to delegation is the re\u00ad\nsponsibility of the healthcare administrative and \neducation team, yet prior to the pediatric nurse \ndelegating any tasks or duties, there must be con\u00ad\nfidence and assurance that the delegate is able to \n412\t\nChapter 28\u2003 Safe and Legal Aspects of\u00a0Care\n", "Caring for a Foster Child\nLegally vulnerable children warrant special consideration \nfrom nurses.

Never share a child\u2019s health in\u00ad\nformation, never leave charts or computer screens \nopen when not in use, never search the records \nof patients who are not your clinical responsibil\u00ad\nity, never give health information over the phone \nunless you are certain that the person posing the \nquestions is a legal guardian or a parent, never \nfax medical information until the fax number is \ndouble-checked and a cover sheet is applied, and \nnever leave any healthcare setting with informa\u00ad\ntion about a child\u2019s clinic visit, home visit, or \nhospitalization.\n\u2022\t Maintaining professional malpractice liability insur\u00ad\nance. Nurses have the freedom to purchase indi\u00ad\nvidual malpractice liability insurance plans. These \nplans are generally affordable and will provide \ncoverage for a lawsuit when breach of a standard \nof care, poor clinical outcome, patient harm, or an \nact of negligence occurs. The American Nurses As\u00ad\nsociation highly suggests that nurses obtain profes\u00ad\nsional malpractice liability insurance, even if they \nhave coverage as part of their healthcare institu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s benefit plan.\nBEST PRACTICES\nFour Ethical Principles That Guide Nursing Care\n\u2022\t Autonomy: The patient\u2019s right to decision mak\u00ad\ning and self-determination.\n\u2022\t Beneficence: The provision of ethically correct \nintention acts of good (without errors).\n\u2022\t Nonmaleficence: Doing no harm, reducing risk, \nand reducing pain or discomfort.\n\u2022\t Justice: Demonstration of fairness, justness, and \nimpartiality in all care and patient interactions.\nFigure 28-4\u2002 As of December 2015, more than 397,000 children were \nin foster care in the United States, and approximately 32% of these \nchildren were waiting for adoption.\n\u00a9 Roylee_photosunday/Shutterstock\n\t\nCaring for a Foster Child\t\n413\n", "in a foster home. Emotional and mental health concerns \nmay surface when a foster child is moved from one home \nsetting to another. The period between fostering a child \nand securing legal adoption is considerable. Some states \nprovide financial support to biological family members \nwho care for a foster child, whereas other states provide \nfinancial assistance to only unrelated foster families for \nthe care they provide.\nMedical foster parenting is also not uncommon. Chil\u00ad\ndren with chronic conditions, with disabilities, or who are \ntechnology dependent, and whose parents or guardians are \nnot able to provide sufficient safe care, will be placed into \nmedical foster homes. Foster parents who provide medical \ncare are considered to provide a protective service when a \nchild has a special-needs diagnosis. Studies suggest that \nat least one-third of children in foster care in the United \nStates have disabilities, ranging from minor developmen\u00ad\ntal delays to significant mental and physical disabilities \n(Blakeslee et\u00a0al., 2013).\nThe most common reasons for placement of children in \nfoster home environments are neglect, abuse, incarcer\u00ad\nated parents, or special circumstances preventing the \nparents or guardians from providing care. The goals of \nfostering children are to provide a nurturing, safe, and \ndevelopmentally supportive environment for short-term \ncare, while the parents or guardians receive assistance \nso that they can resume the child\u2019s care. Reuniting the \nchild with his or her siblings and parents is the primary \ngoal of fostering.\nFoster children may be adopted by a family, or the child \nmay stay within the foster child infrastructure, sometimes \nremaining at one home and at other times experiencing a \nvariety of successive foster homes, until he or she reaches \nthe legal age of 18. A foster parent might not have legal \ndecision-making custody for the foster child. Even if the \nchild is not living with an extended family member, it is not \nuncommon for an aunt, uncle, older sibling, or grandparent \nto have legal rights over the child while the child remains \nCase Study\nLeslie, an experienced pediatric and emergency room nurse, is \nassisting the pediatric oncology healthcare team in a discussion \nwith the family of a 17-year-old patient who has relapsed from \nacute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) for the second time.

The team sits down with \nthe teenager and begins to discuss how he feels, what his \ninterpretation of their discussion for further treatment was, and \nwhat his wishes are and why.

The nurse assigned to the \nchild must provide clear instructions and explanations for \nthe family, advocating for team members to explain what \nthey are doing and why, and what can be expected to come \nnext. For instance, if a young infant is seen in the emergency \ndepartment in a critical state from severe dehydration and \nacidosis related to a prolonged acute viral infection, the\u00a0child \nwill be stabilized in the ED and transferred to the PICU \nfor further observation and higher level of care.

The nurse is responsible for \nmonitoring the patient\u2019s condition for changes in clinical \nstatus and for the administration of ordered treatments. \nThe pediatric nurse communicates across settings to \u00adensure \nthe most seamless process possible. A commitment to \nclearly presenting critical information during handoffs \nacross settings will increase the likelihood that the child \nachieves continued stabilization and receives expeditious \ncare. The nurse should also communicate the nursing and \nmedical treatment plan to the family and, according to the \nprinciples of family-centered care, act as the child\u2019s and \nfamily\u2019s advocate and main support system (Figure 29-1).\nAdvocacy\nWhen a family is experiencing a child\u2019s hospitalization, \nit is typically a crisis beset with unknowns and confus\u00ad\ning scenarios. Many staff members will interact with \nthe family, and consultants may be called in to provide \nBEST PRACTICES\nAdmitting a Child from the Emergency Department \nto the Hospital\nThe nurse must tailor care to help children and families adjust \nto the stress of an ED visit that transitions into a transfer into \nthe hospital. The family may fear separation, unknowns, and \nnew staff members caring for their child in a new department, \nand they may express their emotions in the form of fear, anger, \nsadness, guilt, or helplessness. The nurse must first anticipate \nthese feelings and then attend to them through support and \nexplanations of what is coming next.\nThe registered nurse is often in the position of first \nrecognizing the needs of patients, and is responsible for \nreporting these needs to the professionals assigned to ef\u00ad\nfect changes. The nurse must frequently assess the patient, \nperform the functions of the nursing process, initiate and \nperform complex thinking strategies throughout all phases \nof the nursing process, and act as an advocate for the pa\u00ad\ntient and family. Advocating for patients is considered a \ncore obligation and core principle of the nurse as he or she \ncommits to protecting the well-being, safety, and health of \nthe patient (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2016). \nAs an advocate, the registered nurse (RN) has a primary \nethical responsibility to protect the health, safety, and rights \nof the patient (ANA, 2016).\nFamilies can have strong reactions to the hospitaliza\u00ad\ntion of the child and may feel confused and frightened as \nthe child is transferred between settings. Pediatric patients \nalso have strong reactions based on fear of separation and \npain (Table 29-2). Research has shown that communica\u00ad\ntion, information, and relationships are the three key areas \nimpacting the experience of pediatric hospitalization, \nwhether that experience is good or bad, from the perspective \nof providers, parents, and the hospitalized child (Foster, \nWhitehead, Maybee, & Cullens, 2013).\n\t\nRole of the Registered Nurse\t\n419\n", "TABLE 29-2\u2003 Common Reactions to Hospitalization Across Developmental Stages\nNeonate\n\u203a\u203a\nCommon reactions: Stress reaction, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, sleep deprivation\n\u203a\u203a\nNursing care:\n\u2022\t\nProvide physical comfort, warmth, a quiet time for uninterrupted sleep, and frequent vital signs checking and \ntemperature monitoring.\n\u2022\t\nProvide a source of nutrition at regular intervals to stabilize blood glucose.\nInfant\n\u203a\u203a\nCommon reactions: Stress reaction, older infants fear separation\n\u203a\u203a\nNursing care:\n\u2022\t\nProvide physical comfort.\n\u2022\t\nEncourage the family to stay with the child around the clock.\n\u2022\t\nCare for basic needs rapidly to encourage trust.\n\u2022\t\nReduce opportunities for overstimulation and allow for uninterrupted sleep time.\nToddler\n\u203a\u203a\nCommon reactions: Separation anxiety, stranger anxiety, frustration, defiance, regression, fears assessments and procedures\n\u203a\u203a\nNursing care:\n\u2022\t\nApproach the child with a positive attitude and provide praise for cooperation.\n\u2022\t\nEncourage the family to stay with the child around the clock.\n\u2022\t\nProvide play activities, and balance them with rest.\n\u2022\t\nMinimize stranger interactions.\n\u2022\t\nProvide developmentally appropriate procedural preparation and involve Child Life specialists for support and assistance.\n\u2022\t\nExpect the child to be frustrated and defiant and to have tantrums; stay calm and in control.\n\u2022\t\nOffer choices whenever possible.\nPreschooler\n\u203a\u203a\nCommon reactions: Anxious, fearful, feels punished, magical thinking, fear of body mutilation, aggression, regression\n\u203a\u203a\nNursing care:\n\u2022\t\nExplain what is coming next in a developmentally appropriate way.\n\u2022\t\nEngage the family in providing care.\n\u2022\t\nProvide praise for cooperation.\n\u2022\t\nDo not use language that provokes fear; use simple explanations and speak in a comforting voice.\n\u2022\t\nTry to maintain eye contact at the child\u2019s level.\n\u2022\t\nAllow the child to be involved with care and procedures when possible.\nSchool Age\n\u203a\u203a\nCommon reactions: Stress, emotional withdrawal, fearing procedures, stalling behaviors, fear of \u201cfailing\u201d\n\u203a\u203a\nNursing care:\n\u2022\t\nExplain all procedures and treatment plans at a developmentally appropriate level.\n\u2022\t\nInclude the child (when older than age 7) in treatment decisions and discussions as appropriate.\n\u2022\t\nAllow a small amount of stalling behavior so the child feels some perception of control, but do not allow the child to \ninterrupt procedures.\n\u2022\t\nProvide praise for attempts at self-care.\n\u2022\t\nGive the child duties or small projects to accomplish to increase feelings of industry.\n420\t\nChapter 29\u2003 Care of the Acutely Ill or Critically Ill Child\n", "TABLE 29-2\u2003 Common Reactions to Hospitalization Across Developmental Stages (continued)\nAdolescent\n\u203a\u203a\nCommon reactions: Fears loss of peer interaction, body image fears, rebellion, may withdraw\n\u203a\u203a\nNursing care:\n\u2022\t\nProvide honesty with medical explanations and explain the treatment plan in detail.\n\u2022\t\nEncourage the teen to express feelings and ask questions.\n\u2022\t\nGive choices in timing of procedures and medication administration when able.\n\u2022\t\nProvide privacy, encourage peer interaction, and give alone time.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nPreventing Accidents or Harm in Emergency \nDepartment, PICU, and Acute Care Settings\nSecurity Systems\nBecause EDs and intensive care environments are often \npopulated with family members in distress, escalation of \nverbal and physical violence as well as threats of violence \nare frequently encountered. High levels of anxiety, mixed \nwith the feeling of helplessness and not knowing what will \nhappen next to a vulnerable child, create an environment \nwhere outside-the-norm behavior takes place. Access to \nrapidly responding security services staff members who are \nskilled in managing escalating behaviors or actual violence \nis an imperative.\nMonitoring Systems\nPlacing a child on cardiopulmonary monitors that display heart \nrate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and cyclic blood pres\u00ad\nsure readings with audible alarms allows the pediatric team \nto acknowledge and respond to impending critical changes \nin the child\u2019s condition. Accuracy in setting the alarm limits \nas per the physician\u2019s orders or institutional policy provides \nimmediate information if the child\u2019s vital signs change.\nHospital Equipment Safety\nThe primary nurse assigned to the pediatric patient is respon\u00ad\nsible for rapidly assessing the presence of vital emergency \nresponse equipment. Basic emergency response equipment \nincludes a source of oxygen and a variety of delivery systems \nspanning the array of sizes needed to care for children ranging \nfrom small infants to adolescents. A working suction device \nwith all tubing and suction devices is imperative.

Approximately 25% \nof all ED visits are for children. Demographic data show \nthat male children outnumber female children in these \nvisits, and families at the lowest economic levels of society \naccount for the majority of visits (32%). The average age \nfor children who are treated in the ED and discharged, as \nwell as those children who are stabilized and admitted to \nthe hospital, is 7 years (AHRQ, 2013).\nFigure 29-2\u2002 A color-coded pediatric crash cart must be within \nrapid reach.\nPhoto courtesy of Armstrong Medical Industries, Inc.\n\t\nEntering the Emergency Department\t\n421\n", "etiology of the clinical presentation. Once stabilization oc\u00ad\ncurs, the child may need further diagnostics and a transfer \ninto the critical care setting; alternatively, the child may be \nadmitted for further observation and treatment onto the pe\u00ad\ndiatric hospital acute care unit. The determination to transfer \nshould be done with an interdisciplinary focus. Critically \nill children (i.e., children with a potentially life-altering or \nlife-threatening illness or injury) should not be transferred \nto a hospital bed where the receiving nurse will be caring \nfor other children as well as the new admission. Know\u00ad\ning which resources, equipment, personnel, and skills are \nrequired for stabilization of children means the ED staff \nmust have both specialized training and experience with \nchildren across the developmental period (Table 29-3).\nPriorities of stabilization in the ED start with a visual \nassessment of the child\u2019s status. The Pediatric Assessment \nTriangle (PAT) is commonly used in emergency medicine \nand nursing interdisciplinary teams to determine when to \nPediatric healthcare teams working in emergency \nroom settings must be competent in rapid assessment and \n\u00adstabilization (i.e., achievement of homeostasis). Caring for \nchildren spanning the developmental periods from newborn \nthrough adolescence requires that the emergency team be \ncompetent in performing developmentally appropriate \nassessments. These assessments require recognition of the \ndifferences in anatomy and physiology for infants, children, \nteens, and adults, and use of appropriate assessment tools. \nDifferences in equipment selection and specialized skills are \nrequired for transport, assessment of injuries or illnesses \nin children, and stabilization.\nYoung children presenting with a critical injury or illness \nmay compensate for that condition for a period of time, \nthen experience rapid deterioration.

Handoffs \nmust be comprehensive enough to provide information \non the child\u2019s entire care experience, from the time the \nchild came to the ED to the moment of handoff. Most \nhealthcare institutions have established a handoff policy \nand specific guidelines. Most handoffs include the fol\u00ad\nlowing components:\n\u2022\t The child\u2019s age, weight, height, allergies, pri\u00ad\nmary language, developmental level, and medical \ndiagnosis(es)\n\u2022\t Pertinent past medical history\n\u2022\t Summary of recent care required, including out\u00ad\ncomes of laboratory analysis, diagnostics, and inter\u00ad\nactions with specialists\n\u2022\t Recent vital signs or other monitoring information\n\u2022\t Current medications and timing of critical infu\u00ad\nsions, such as last antibiotics, and recent peaks and \ntrough values\n\u2022\t Summary of information related to body systems\u2014\nfor example, for the respiratory system: rate, depth, \noxygen saturations, need for suctioning, need for \noxygen delivery, presence of retractions, and overall \nrespiratory efficacy and status\n\u2022\t Diagnostic results pending\n\u2022\t Status of family dynamics and needs; presence of \nfamily at the bedside and their level of involvement\n\u2022\t Known aspects of the medical treatment plan\n\u2022\t Pertinent aspects of the child\u2019s temperament, emo\u00ad\ntional needs, and play needs\nProcedural Sedation\nThe use of conscious sedation during invasive bedside \nprocedures is not uncommon in the PICU setting. Children \nwho require lumbar punctures, bone marrow aspirations or \nbiopsies, and placement of chest tubes or bedside central \nlines will require a level of procedural sedation. This type \nof sedation involves the child breathing independently but \nrequires constant visual supervision and rapid airway sup\u00ad\nport by a certified team. The PICU nurse may be assigned \nto obtain the signature for procedural informed consent \nfrom the parent or legal guardian and to document the \nprocedure minute by minute at the bedside. The PICU \nintensivist or other primary caregiver will provide airway \nmanagement and administration of the sedation medica\u00ad\ntion (e.g., propofol). The team works together seamlessly to \nprovide safety at all times. Alarms require rapid attention \nto prevent harm.\nTransferring Children to the Pediatric \nIntensive Care Unit\nAfter stabilization in the ED, a child may be either discharged, \nadmitted to the acute care pediatric unit, or transferred to \na critical care or pediatric intensive care unit for further \nmonitoring and an advanced level of interdisciplinary \ncare. The objective of the ED personnel is to provide the \nneeded assessment, initial diagnostics, and stabilization \nin the ED setting, and then, when warranted, transfer the \nchild as soon as possible to the intensive care unit (ICU). \nLengthy time periods in the ED are stressful for families, \nas these environments offer little room for rest, nutrition, \nand self-care of family members.\nOnce the child is in the PICU, implementation of \nfamily-centered care should include open visitation, family \npresence during invasive procedures, family-centered round\u00ad\ning, and family conferences (Meert, Clark, & Eggly, 2013).\nSupervision at the Bedside of a \nCritically Ill Child\nChildren are transferred to intensive care settings when \ntheir condition requires an increased level of nursing care \nand continuous monitoring on cardiac and respiratory \nmonitors. Children with significant injuries, life-threatening \ninfectious processes, or conditions that affect their neu\u00ad\nrologic status are treated in an ICU setting, where direct \nnursing care is provided in 1:1 or 1:2 ratios. This high level \nof monitoring ensures that the interdisciplinary pediatric \nteam receives information on the child\u2019s minute-by-minute \nclinical status and facilitates rapid responses if the child\u2019s \ncondition declines. The staff in the pediatric intensive care \nenvironment is prepared to respond to hemodynamic \ninstability, airway compromise, cardiopulmonary arrest, \nor any other status in need of rapid response.\nWithin the ICU setting, children are typically placed in \nindividual rooms with glass doors facing a central nursing \nstation. This setup provides for visual monitoring of the \nchild\u2019s condition and visual access to the cardiopulmonary \nmonitors. The frequency of supervision depends on the \nacuity level of the child.\nSafety Through Handoffs Across Settings\nNursing supervision of children placed in PICU settings \nrequires specialized skills, training, and advanced-level \nknowledge of critical conditions. One of the most important \nskills of the PICU nurse is effective professional communi\u00ad\ncation. Such a nurse must be able to participate in bedside \nrounds and make contributions to the team concerning the \noutcomes of the higher-level monitoring and supervision.\n424\t\nChapter 29\u2003 Care of the Acutely Ill or Critically Ill Child\n", "A full time-out is required for safety before any procedure \nis begun, and all members of the team who will be involved \nwith the procedure must be present during this meeting. The \npediatric nurse makes sure the time-out confirms the patient\u2019s \nfull name, birth date, medical record number, diagnosis, \nprocedure to be implemented, and assurance of consent. \nDue to the risky nature of procedural sedation, it is impera\u00ad\ntive that the nurse ensures a full time-out is performed and \ndocuments that the time-out occurred and who was present.\nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nAlarm Fatigue and Safety in the Critical Care Unit\nA growing concern for teams of providers in critical care or \nintensive care units is the potential for alarm fatigue. When \nexposed to the sensory stimulation of excessive monitor \nalarms, a nurse can become immune to the sound of the \nalarm and not hear it. The sound of the alarms, combined \nwith the excessive frequency with which the alarms go off \nin a chaotic environment, may cause a sensory desensitiza\u00ad\ntion. This phenomenon can lead to a lack of response or a \ndelayed response, which in turn has been associated with \npatient deaths (American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, \n2013). Alarm fatigue is a complex but critical safety concern \nfor children who are monitored in critical care environments. \nAlarms intended to rapidly notify a team member of a change \nin clinical condition should never be ignored, silenced, turned \ndown, or turned off.\nTABLE 29-4\u2003 Hospital Emergency Codes\nAlthough hospitals vary in their use of color-coded alarms, \nthe following codes are often used in ED, PICU, and acute \ncare settings to alert the pediatric healthcare team that \nsupport is required. Check with your healthcare institutions \nfor its exact codes used, and become familiar with them to \nensure help is provided expeditiously.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode blue: A cardiopulmonary arrest is taking place. The \ncode team must respond to help provide resuscitation \nassistance.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode red: A fire is occurring in the building. Safety \nprocedures for containment, evacuation, and emergency \nresponse must be followed to reduce injury or prevent \ndeath.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode orange: A hazardous material has been spilled. A \nteam approach is required for containment, evacuation, \nrescue, and cleanup. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) \nare used as guidelines to prevent injury.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode yellow: A bomb threat is currently happening. A \nrehearsed approach for safety of the staff and patients is \nrequired.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode triage: A mass-casualty incident has occurred. \nInstitutional policies need to be implemented to prepare \nfor the care of a large number of ill and injured persons, \npossibly representing ages across the lifespan; the response \nneeds to be rapidly coordinated and resources allocated.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode gray: A threatening person is currently in the \nfacility. A team approach is needed to provide support to \nthose involved and to provide safety for those near the \nescalating situation.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode pink: A newborn or infant abduction has occurred. \nProcedures need to be activated to secure stairwells, exits, \nand elevators while a search is conducted to find the baby.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode purple: An older child has been abducted. \nProcedures need to be activated to secure stairwells, \nexits, and elevators while a search is conducted to find \nthe missing child.\n\u203a\u203a\nCode silver: An active shooter or a person with a gun is \nthreatening an individual or group. Rapid safety and \nsecurity processes are needed to prevent injury or death.\nTransferring Children to the Pediatric \nAcute Care Hospital Unit\nChildren who no longer need a higher level of observation \nand monitoring will be transferred to the pediatric hospital \nunit in preparation for discharge. Pediatric hospital units, \ncalled pediatric acute care units, provide continued assess\u00ad\nments and, if the technology is available, monitoring, but \nat a lesser level of intensity, without the need for 1:1 or 1:2 \nnursing care ratios. Families typically express relief when the \ntransfer occurs, as the transfer of care may signify that the \nchild is now clinically stable and is healing. Other families \nmay become more stressed, however, as they know the child \nwill not be provided the same level of advanced care and \nfrequency of observation that was received in the intensive \ncare environment. Education, support, and anticipatory \nguidance must be provided to relieve their worries. Eliciting \nthe assistance of a social worker and a Child Life specialist \ncan be helpful if the family expresses concern about the \ntransfer to a lower level of care.\nMany pediatric acute care hospitals post the phone \nnumber and criteria for calling a rapid response team (akin \nto the code blue team) if the child\u2019s condition worsens while \non the pediatric hospital unit (Table 29-4). Families may \nfind comfort in knowing that they can call for immediate \nhelp by taking steps beyond pressing the call light button \nat the child\u2019s bedside, as this call may not be answered right \naway. Research has shown that posting the criteria for and \nphone number of a rapid response team does not lead to \nan inappropriate use of the service by family members. \nThe pediatric nurse must be very familiar with how to call \n\t\nTransferring Children to the Pediatric Acute Care Hospital Unit\t\n425\n", "a code blue team, rapid response team, or any number of \npossible \u201ccodes\u201d that provide rapid assistance (Figure 29-5).\nThe transfer a child from the PICU to the pediatric \nhospital unit requires a thorough handoff. It is not un\u00ad\ncommon for the PICU nurse to accompany the child and \nfamily down to the receiving unit to make sure the handoff \nreport is given directly to the nurse who will be providing \ncare. The receiving nurse should then make sure the acute \ncare hospitalist knows about the timing of the transfer, as \nQUALITY AND SAFETY\nAdvanced Emergency Response Certifications\nNurses can become certified in a number of areas where \nadvanced assessments and skills are taught. Four examples \ninclude the following certifications:\n\u2022\t Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS)\n\u2022\t Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP)\n\u2022\t Adult Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)\n\u2022\t Emergency Nursing Pediatric Course (ENPC)\nFor more information on the PALS, NRP, and ACLS certifications, see \nthe American Heart Association\u2019s website (http://www.heart.org/\nHEARTORG/).

The family will be anxious to meet the physician \nassigned to their child\u2019s care on the new unit and discuss \nthe revised interdisciplinary care plan.\nPreparing the Family for Discharge\nWhen the child\u2019s condition improves to the point that dis\u00ad\ncharge is pending, the nurse moves into the role of educator. \nThe family needs to be taught how to safely administer any \nmedication or treatment independently at home. The family \nalso needs to know the indications for and side effects of all \nmedications. Follow-up appointments must be explained. \nMost importantly, the family needs to know which clinical \nsigns or symptoms arising in the child warrant a call to the \nphysician or a return to the ED.\nDischarge should be a celebratory event for families\u2014\none that is greatly anticipated and welcomed. Taking the \ntime to explain all discharge instructions will reduce the \nchance of readmission (also known as recidivism).\nCase Study\nA 4-month-old infant has presented to the emergency \ndepartment with a history of fevers, poor oral intake, \nproductive cough, and increasing lethargy.

These life-changing effects can be \nconsequential in daily functioning. Grief, or the process of \ndeep sorrow, can last a lifetime, can have impact on the par\u00ad\nent\u2019s ability to function at work (Fox, Cacciatore, & Lacasse, \n2014), and can strain a marriage (Kastenbaum, 2015). Grief \ncan also significantly impact how the parents interact with \nthe surviving siblings.\nBecause the death of a child is so often unexpected, an \nunhealthy reaction that can develop is called dysfunctional \ngrief. Here, one demonstrates complicated grief over a \nperiod of at least a year. Dysfunctional grief entails pro\u00ad\nlonged emotional reactions, including longing, loneliness, \nyearnings for the child, depression, low self-esteem, sleep \ndisturbances, eating disturbances, and inability to function \nin roles such as employment and marriage (Lee, 2015).\nFor the pediatric healthcare team, the loss of a child can \nalso produce a level of grief that has a significant impact \non their ability to function professionally. It is imperative \nthat a pediatric healthcare provider who experiences a \nchild\u2019s death be offered opportunities to debrief, talk about \nthe circumstances associated with the death, and receive \nprofessional help (Figure 30-1).\nBEST PRACTICES\nH\nealthcare professionals who work in environments when \nthere is a potential for the death of a child would benefit \ngreatly from training in how best to communicate with the \ndying child, the child\u2019s siblings, and the child\u2019s parents. The \npertinent aspects of communication in the dying process \ninclude being able to provide support, being honest about \ndeath, explaining the process of caring for a dying child or \na dead child\u2019s body, and describing the care needed for the \nchild\u2019s siblings.\nFigure 30-1\u2002 It is imperative that a pediatric healthcare provider \nwho experiences a child\u2019s death be offered opportunities to debrief, \ntalk about the circumstances associated with the death, and receive \nprofessional help.\n\u00a9 jonathandowney/iStockphoto.com\nDevelopmental Aspects of \nUnderstanding Death\nChildren\u2019s understanding of death is highly dependent \non their developmental stage. Most young children do \nnot comprehend what is happening to them and, there\u00ad\nfore, might display their emotions by clinging to their \nprimary caregiver and fearing separation. Older children, \nowing to their concrete thinking abilities, are able to \nunderstand the permanence of death and may display \ntheir emotions by asking poignant questions, eliciting \ninformation about the dying process (i.e., the predictable \nphysiological changes and emotional states that occur as \nthe end of life approaches), and sharing their concerns. \nEach developmental stage has predictable responses to \nthe dying process and predictable levels of understand\u00ad\ning of death. Culture, ethnicity, religion, spirituality, and \nopenness of family discussions can all influence how a \nchild comprehends death and dying.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nDevelopmental Factors Associated with Death\nEach developmental stage has unique perspectives and levels \nof understanding concerning death. In general, the nurse can \npredict the responses and needs of the dying child accord\u00ad\ning to their developmental stage.\nInfants\n\u2022\t Have no concept of death\n\u2022\t May show reactions concerning hospitalization, \n\u00adincluding fears of separation and stranger anxiety\n\u2022\t React to changes in their routine\n\u2022\t Must have their needs cared for immediately to \n\u00adcontinue the process of building trust\n(continues)\n430\t\nChapter 30\u2003 The Dying Child\n", "Toddlers\n\u2022\t Have little or no concept of the permanence of \ndeath\n\u2022\t Will demonstrate egocentric thinking and processing \nof information\n\u2022\t Often reflect the emotions displayed by the adults\u2014\nanxiety, sadness, anger\n\u2022\t Continue to show anxiety and powerful reactions to \nmedical procedures, fear of pain and discomfort, and \nboth stranger and separation anxiety\n\u2022\t May be very clingy and emotionally needy\nPreschoolers\n\u2022\t Participate in magical thinking\u2014they believe their \nthoughts have power and can cause events to take \nplace, such as death\n\u2022\t May connect the dying process with punishment\n\u2022\t Often see death as temporary and reversible\n\u2022\t Continue to demonstrate egocentric thinking and \nprocessing\n\u2022\t May demonstrate regressive behaviors to an earlier \ndevelopmental stage (acting in an infant-like or \ntoddler-like manner)\nSchool-Age Children\n\u2022\t By the age of 7 to 8 years, process death as perma\u00ad\nnent, inevitable, and universal\n\u2022\t May not be able to comprehend their own \nimmortality\n\u2022\t Express fears specific to the dying process\n\u2022\t Respond to factual information and ask many ques\u00ad\ntions related to death; may show fascination with \ndetails about death\n\u2022\t May be uncooperative, defiant, and frustrating \nin their behaviors, which are based in fear of the \nunknown\n\u2022\t See death as something beyond their control\nAdolescents\n\u2022\t See death and the death process as adults do\u2014as \nuniversal, inevitable, and irreversible\n\u2022\t May show frustration and anger with dying, as this is \nthe period of time when they are learning their iden\u00ad\ntity and thinking about their future\n\u2022\t Often continue to depend on their peers and their \nsocial network for support, though those networks \nmay diminish as peers become frightened or unable \nto process the teen\u2019s death\n\u2022\t May push family away and then feel isolated\n\u2022\tCan be very distressed about changes in their \nphysical appearance associated with the dying \nprocess\nData from Webb, N.

This reaction may be based on the adult\u2019s \nprevious experiences with loss or professional background. \nMost parents suffer tremendous feelings of grief and loss \n(Figure 30-2). Some parents may have healthy reactions, \nincluding being supportive of others, and providing comfort \nand support to grieving siblings. Other parents who have \nstrained interpersonal relationships, personal stressors, social \nisolation, and spiritual distress may demonstrate unhealthy \nresponses, including social withdrawal, substance abuse, \nself-harm, and isolation (Kastenbaum, 2015).\nThe pediatric nurse must be able to identify the needs \nof the parents and reach out to them as appropriate. The \nsupport provided to a parent of a dying child should be \ninterdisciplinary, family centered, care focused, and non\u00ad\njudgmental. Understanding the widely accepted model of \nthe series of predictable emotional stages experienced by \nthose who are surviving a child\u2019s death, as developed by \nElisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross (1969), can greatly assist the pedi\u00ad\natric nurse in understanding the emotional responses of \na parent. K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s (1969) stages of grief are usually \nexperienced in the following order and can be applied to a \nparent\u2019s reaction to the impending death of his or her child:\n1.\t Denial: The first reaction experienced by a parent \nis characterized by shock and disbelief.\n2.\t Anger: The parent realizes that he or she cannot \nchange the situation and the death of the child is \nimminent and a reality.\n3.\t Bargaining: The parent tries to hold onto hope of \navoidance by negotiating for more time, or by ne\u00ad\ngotiating with a spiritual or religious force.\n\t\nReactions of Parents and Siblings\t\n431\n", "4.\t Depression: The parent demonstrates great sadness, \nmournfulness, isolation, grief, and sullenness.\n5.\t Acceptance: The parent embraces the very real or \ninevitable impending death of the child.\nFAMILY EDUCATION\nReactions of Siblings to the Death of a Child\nThe siblings of a dying child may experience tremendous \ngrief. The loss of a sibling to illness, accident, or a chronic \ndisorder can cause children to grieve for both the child and \nthe family unit. In addition, they may experience grief because \nthe attention and care of the dying child takes precedence \nover their own needs. If the dying process is lengthy, siblings \nmay be very sad and depressed over the loss of family time, \nfamily interactions, and closeness with the parents. Siblings\u2019 \nunderstanding of the death process will be influenced by their \ndevelopmental stage. They need to be talked to with honesty, \nnot avoided or prevented from building an understanding of \nwhat is happening. Acting out, emotional neediness, physical \nsymptoms of gastrointestinal distress, symptoms of depres\u00ad\nsion, poor academic performance, sleep disturbances, and \nnightmares are all common among siblings of a dying child.\nFigure 30-3\u2002 Palliative care focuses on building and implementation \nof a therapeutic environment for the dying child.\n\u00a9 LADA/Science Source\nTypes of Care for the Dying Child\nEnd-of-life care is a phrase used synonymously with pallia\u00ad\ntive care. Nevertheless, one should distinguish the aspects \nof end-of-life care that are different from palliative care.\nThe term palliative care refers to a multidisciplinary \napproach to the process of dying that can begin before the \nphysiological aspects of dying start. This kind of care can be \noffered to the child and the family during the early process \nof a poor prognosis. Palliative care includes support with last \nwishes or \u201cbucket lists\u201d that the family wants to experience \nbefore the loss of the child, and includes conversations about \nthe wishes of the family concerning the death process and \nafter death plans. Palliative care recognizes that there is no \ncure for the child\u2019s condition, so it focuses on emotional \nsupport, resource allocation, symptom management, educa\u00ad\ntion, honest and straightforward communication with all \nfamily members involved in the child\u2019s dying process, and \nthe building and implementation of a therapeutic environ\u00ad\nment for the dying child. In other words, palliative care is \na unique and comprehensive plan to promote quality of \nlife for the time that is left (Figure 30-3).\nPalliative care can also refer to the types of medical \ntreatments offered to the child. For example, for a child \nwith a terminal oncologic diagnosis, palliative radiation \nmay be administered to shrink tumors that do not respond \nto chemotherapy or are considered inoperable. Palliative \nchemotherapy may be administered not to seek a cure, but \nrather to decrease a tumor size or burden and so provide \nrelief from symptoms. These kinds of palliative measures \nmay also include surgical debulking of tumor size or re\u00ad\nmoval of a tumor that is causing pain.\nThe term end-of-life care is often used to describe the \ncare aspects of the dying process. It can denote the wishes, \ncultural practices, and care activities surrounding the \n\u00adimminent death of the child.\nPhysiological Aspects of the Dying \nProcess\nThe human body, regardless of the age, goes through pre\u00ad\ndictable physiological changes during the dying process. \nIn general, a child may potentially display 12 signs of \nimpending death (Palliative Care Australia, n.d.):\n\u2022\t Signs of increasing physical weakness, evidence of \nfatigue, and increased desire to sleep\n\u2022\t Increasing disorientation and confusion; may try to \nget up to find someone or do something\n\u2022\t Loss of appetite\n\u2022\t Inability to swallow, which poses a choking risk and \nproduces discomfort if attempts are made to drink \nor eat, or if someone places food or drink in the \nchild\u2019s mouth\n\u2022\t Slowed metabolism\n\u2022\t Changes in the gastrointestinal system, including \nslowed or diminished peristalsis and elimination\n\u2022\t Changes in the genitourinary system, as the kid\u00ad\nneys are shutting down and not producing urine\n\u2022\t Buildup of waste products in the blood, which may \ncontribute to an increasing state of lethargy and \neventually coma\n432\t\nChapter 30\u2003 The Dying Child\n", "Psychosocial Aspects of the Dying Process\nThe family of a dying child may be struggling with the \ncessation of all diagnostic and curative efforts to assist the \nchild\u2019s progressing injury, disease, or condition. It is very \nhard for many parents to accept the process of first partici\u00ad\npating in aggressive treatment and cure models and then \nswitching to only palliative measures. Often, the application \nof technology such as monitoring systems, intravenous \nfluids, and central lines is withheld as the child begins the \nfinal dying stages. Parents need tremendous psychological \nsupport during this difficult time.\nChildren who are trying to understand the process \nthey are going through, and trying to understand the \nemotional reactions of those around them, can struggle \nwith their own psychosocial aspects of dying. Before they \nexperience a decreased level of consciousness or loss of \nconsciousness, they may ask provocative questions about \nwhat will happen to them as they die. It is important that \nthe pediatric healthcare team help the dying child both \nphysically with symptom management so comfort can be \nobtained, and mentally and spiritually. The pediatric nurse \nshould be prepared to be close to the child and answer any \nquestions about spiritual concerns. Open communication is \nimperative during this difficult time. The nurse should not \nattempt to proscribe his or her own religious or spiritual \nbeliefs to the child; rather, the nurse should ask questions \nabout the child\u2019s beliefs and understandings of death and \nsupport whatever the child states or describes. The follow\u00ad\ning open-ended questions may be of value:\n\u2022\t \u201cTell me about your understanding of your \ncondition.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cTell me about your understanding of death.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cTell me about your thoughts of what happens after \ndeath.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cTell me about what is important to you and your \nfamily right now.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cTell me how I can help you and your family right \nnow.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cTell me anything I can get for you for your com\u00ad\nfort at this time.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t \u201cTell me if there is someone you want to talk to \nright now.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\u2022\t Early phases of imminent death: tachypnea and \n\u00adlabored breathing\n\u2022\t Later phases of imminent death: a classic breathing \npattern called Cheyne-Stokes respiration, marked \nby gradual hyperpnea or hypoapnea followed by \na period of apnea; demonstrates evidence of hy\u00ad\npoperfusion of the respiratory center in the brain \n(Figure 30-4)\n\u2022\t Peripheral blood shunting that leaves the hands, \nfingers, and toes cool to the touch\n\u2022\t Mottling of the skin that leaves a pattern like a jig\u00ad\nsaw puzzle of darkened lines\nPHARMACOLOGY\nS\nymptom management for children who are dying is \nchallenging and often the responsibility of the pediatric \nnurse. Research has shown that only 27% of dying children \nexperience pain relief and that the four most common \nsymptoms experienced during a child\u2019s last weeks of life are \npain, poor appetite, fatigue, and respiratory distress (Cherny, \n2010). Knowledge of palliative care, traditional medications, \nand adjunctive therapies is a priority in providing holistic \ncare. One must take into consideration the child\u2019s previous \nexperiences with narcotics, each medication\u2019s half-life, ad\u00ad\nministration guidelines, institutional formulary (approval), \ntolerance level, potential symptoms, and drug allergy. \nMedications that may be used in children during the dy\u00ad\ning process include the following (Gregoire & Frager, 2006; \nWorld Health Organization [WHO], 2013):\nPain Control\n\u2022\t Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone, fentanyl, \noxycodone, and hydromorphone\nOral Secretion Control (Antisecretory Agents)\n\u2022\t Transdermal or subcutaneous anticholinergics such as \nhyoscine hydrobromide, atropine, hyoscine butylbro\u00ad\nmide, and glycopyrronium/glycopyrrolate\n\u2022\t Antimuscarinic drugs\nAntianxiety Agents\n\u2022\t Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam\nAdjuvant Medications for Breakthrough Pain\n\u2022\t Tricyclic antidepressants such as serotonin\u2013\u00ad\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\u2022\t Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\u2022\t Anticonvulsants (for neuropathic pain) such as carba\u00ad\nmazepine and gabapentin\nAntinausea Medications\n\u2022\t Serotonin 5-hydroxytriptamine antagonist such as \nondansetron\n\u2022\t Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide for delayed \ngastric emptying\nFigure 30-4\u2002 Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern.\nCheyne-Stokes breathing\n1 min\n1 min\nInspiration/expiration\n\t\nPsychosocial Aspects of the Dying Process\t\n433\n", "offer reassurance that he or she is cared for, cher\u00ad\nished, and will be kept comfortable.\n\u2022\t When appropriate, encourage the child to feel per\u00ad\nmission from loved ones to die; some children may \nfeel fear of hurting their parents and siblings and \nneed encouragement to relax and let go.\nSettings for a Dying Child\nWhen able, the pediatric healthcare team should discuss \nwith the family in advance what their wishes are concern\u00ad\ning the setting in which the child will die.\nHospital\nChildren may die in a hospital setting, especially if they \nexperience a traumatic death from an injury or accident. \nChildren who have an expected shorter lifespan from com\u00ad\nplications associated with a chronic illness or congenital \nanomaly may not benefit from dying in a hospital setting. \nNot all urban, suburban, and rural communities in the \nUnited States have inpatient hospice units, so the choice may \nbe made to have a child die in the hospital. Not all families \ndesire this outcome, but others may choose the hospital \nsetting over having the child die at home. Because hospi\u00ad\ntal settings focus on diagnostics and treatments, hospital \nnurses may not feel comfortable or have the competencies \nrequired for a peaceful and symptom-controlled death in \nan acute care setting.\nPediatric Nursing Care for the \nDying Child\nCaring for the dying child takes specialized skills. Develop\u00ad\ning a care plan and providing help for the family of a dying \nchild should take the following considerations into account:\n\u2022\t Provide a quiet, warm, nurturing, low-stress \nenvironment for the child and family that feels \ncomfortable.\n\u2022\t Continue to provide warm baths, skin care, mouth \ncare, hair brushing, and the basic elements of \nmeticulous nursing care that promote a sense of \nwell-being and comfort.\n\u2022\t Be honest about the expected course of events; \nexplain the diagnosis, prognosis, medications, and \nresources available.\n\u2022\t Do not isolate the family; frequently check in with \nthem and offer support, even if it is in silence.\n\u2022\t Encourage the family to talk, share, and express \ntheir emotions with the team; encourage the child, \nsiblings, and parents to ask questions.\n\u2022\t Secure the assistance of the Child Life team to \noffer education, support, medical play, and com\u00ad\nmunication with the child\u2019s school, teachers, and \nschoolmates.\n\u2022\t Continue to provide the child with distractions, \nplay opportunities, and moments of joy found only \nin childhood.\n\u2022\t Promote the disclosure and solicitation of support \nand assistance from the family\u2019s social network, \nneighbors, and community; encourage others to \nprovide food, comfort, respite care for the siblings, \nand overall support of the grieving parents.\n\u2022\t Ask the child what his or her wishes are; secure ap\u00ad\nplications for organizations that provide \u201clast wish\u201d \nfulfillments for terminally ill children.\n\u2022\t Mobilize an interdisciplinary team approach; as\u00ad\nsemble a team of pediatric professionals who can be \ncomprehensive in their views and diverse in their \nsupport. Team members should include physicians, \nnurses, social workers, chaplains, child psycholo\u00ad\ngists, pharmacists, and case managers.\n\u2022\t Secure involvement with the desired clergy or spiri\u00ad\ntual support networks.\n\u2022\t Provide comprehensive symptom management for \nthe child and keep the child clean, dry, and in posi\u00ad\ntions of comfort; encourage physical contact and \ncuddling as tolerated.\n\u2022\t In the last stages of the dying process, assess the \nchild\u2019s ability to swallow; provide nutrition and oral \nfluids only if safe to prevent choking.\n\u2022\t Provide comfort to the child by telling the child \nthat he or she is not alone in the dying process, and \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE\nA\nccording to Dussel et\u00a0al. (2009), parents who have the \nopportunity to plan the location of their child\u2019s death \nare more likely to have the child die at home. A significantly \ngreater number who plan for the location of the child\u2019s death \nreport feeling prepared for the child\u2019s end of life.\nPediatric Hospice Settings\nIt is important to distinguish between hospice care and \npalliative care. Hospice care is provided to a child nearing \nthe end of the life when the application of medical diag\u00ad\nnostics and treatments is no longer considered. Palliative \ncare, which is a part of hospice care, is also a separate area \nof medical and nursing practice provided while the patient \nis still receiving treatment for the condition. Hospice care \nis provided to give the child and the family the best qual\u00ad\nity of life possible in the last 6 months of the child\u2019s life.\nAlthough such facilities are few and far between, children \nwho are dying may be able to have their death experience \ntake place in a hospice setting created especially for children. \n434\t\nChapter 30\u2003 The Dying Child\n", "obstruction, aspiration, poisonings or toxic exposures, falls, \nmotor vehicle accidents, seizure disorders, complications of \ncongenital anomalies, and sudden infant death syndrome \n(SIDS) or sudden unexpected death in childhood (SUDC).\nPediatric healthcare professionals who work in environ\u00ad\nments where children receive care after traumatic events \nmust have specialized skills in caring for the family during \nthe shock and disbelief phase. The team must immediately \nmobilize multiple resources such as a social worker, nurse \nadministrator, psychologist, hospital chaplain, and other \npersonnel who are experienced with helping a family during \nthe initial emotional upheaval. Child Life specialists can \nassist with the collection of hair, footprints, and handprints \nalong with photographs using a preassembled memory box. \nWhen possible, the parents should be allowed to witness \nthe resuscitation of the child. Great sensitivity must be \ndisplayed to the child\u2019s body after prolonged resuscitation \nefforts, and family members need time with the child to \nsay goodbye before the child is wrapped and taken to the \nmorgue. Ensure that the family has safe transportation home \nafter the loss of a child. Securing follow-up emotional help \nis also an unwritten responsibility of the team. The child \nand family should be kept together as long as desired and \nfeasible. When an infant or child dies in the emergency \nroom setting, the medical examiner must also be notified.\nRegardless of the setting where a child experiences the \ndying process, the child should be respected and offered \nsupport to ensure an honest, dignified dying process. In \n2012, the United Nations General Assembly created the \nTrieste Charter, a list of rights of the dying child within \nthe United Nations\u2019 declaration of the rights of the child \n(Benini, Vecchi, & Orzalesi, 2014):\n\u2022\t To be considered a person until death irrespective \nof age, location, illness, and care setting\n\u2022\t To receive effective treatment for pain, and \u00ad\nphysical and psychological symptoms causing \nsuffering, through qualified, comprehensive, and \ncontinuous care\n\u2022\t To be listened to and properly informed about \nhis or her illness with consideration for his or her \nwishes, age, and ability to understand\n\u2022\t To participate, on the basis of his or her abilities, \nvalues, and wishes, in care choices about his or her \nlife, illness, and death\n\u2022\t To express and, whenever possible, have his or \nher feelings, wishes, and expectations taken into \naccount\n\u2022\t To have his or her cultural, spiritual, and religious be\u00ad\nliefs respected and receive spiritual care and support \nin accordance with his or her wishes and choices\n\u2022\t To have a social and relational life suitable to his or \nher age, illness, and expectations\nWhen a child is believed to be in the last 6 months of life, \nthe family can be referred to a hospice institution for \ncontinued care. The pediatric healthcare hospice team is \ntrained to provide end-of-life care in a setting that mimics \na home environment with comfortable furniture, soothing \nlighting, and minimal stimulation.\nUNIQUE FOR KIDS\nH\nospice care differs for children who are dying versus \nadults who are dying, as children\u2019s developmental needs \nare incorporated into the hospice care plan. Hospice nurses \nworking with dying children have a foundation of knowledge \naround developmental stages and developmental theories \nthat enables them to provide comprehensive and supportive \ncare across childhood.\nPediatric Hospice Services at Home\nPediatric home hospice services should be secured when\u00ad\never possible. Specific conditions must be met for a child \nto die at home while being assisted with hospice services. \nAn adult must be present who is willing and capable to care \nfor the child both emotionally and via symptom manage\u00ad\nment. Goals of pediatric hospice care provided to families \nare threefold and should include identifying and reducing \nstress for all those involved (Baranowski, n.d.; Center for \nHospice Care Southeast Connecticut, 2016):\n\u2022\t The provision of hands-on help with the day-to-day \ncare of a child in palliative care or who is actively in \nthe dying phases\n\u2022\t The provision of emotional, spiritual, and bereave\u00ad\nment support and the promotion of well-being for \nboth the patient and the family\n\u2022\t The provision of care for the caregivers providing \nfor the child, including education, listening, and \nbackup support\nTraumatic Death in the Emergency \nDepartment\nAlthough such events are rare, the traumatic and unex\u00ad\npected death of a child is a profound loss. A traumatic \nloss is a very different experience than the loss of a child \nwho has been battling a chronic or life-threatening condi\u00ad\ntion for a period of time. Both experiences produce great \nemotional responses, but a traumatic death can also pro\u00ad\nduce tremendous guilt and extreme despair.

She was \ndiagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia 3 years ago and has \nexperienced a relapse of her leukemia 3 times. She is no longer \nreceiving chemotherapy or any treatment beyond palliative care.\nThe pediatric oncology team has explained to the family \nthat Kathleen is in and out of a coma-like state and is consid\u00ad\nered to need total care by the nursing staff. The team further \nexplains to the family that her breathing pattern, decreasing \nurine production, refusal of food and fluids, and skin mottling \nare all evidence of Kathleen\u2019s impending death. The parents \nattended a care conference in the morning with the medical \nstaff, pediatric oncologist, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) \ndirector, social worker, nurse manager, charge nurse on duty, \nchild psychologist, and case manager. It was decided that \nKathleen\u2019s care would be transferred to the pediatric hospice \nfacility as soon as feasible so the family could be together in \na setting conducive for the experience of her death.\nKathleen has four male siblings; she is the second young\u00ad\nest in her family. Her eldest brother is overseas, serving in the \nmilitary. Her youngest sibling is a preschooler.\nCase Study Questions\n1.\t What are the common reactions that a pediatric nurse \ncan expect from Kathleen\u2019s family members?\n2.\t What are the stages of death and dying according to \nK\u00fcbler-Ross?\n3.\t What are the developmental issues surrounding death \nfor a teenager?\n4.\t Which decisions should be made by the family prior to \nthe final dying process of the child?\n5.\t What are issues and decisions that can be made at the \ntime of the teen\u2019s death?\nAs the Case Evolves.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nKathleen\u2019s parent asks the nurse to assist in helping their child \nwith the symptoms of dry mouth and lips.

The death of a child \ncan be emotionally traumatic for the child\u2019s immediate \nfamily and those within the family\u2019s community. The \ndeath of a child has life-changing effects on survivors. \nGrief may affect the parents\u2019 ability to function at work \nand in relationships. Grief can also have a significant \nimpact on how the parents interact with the surviving \nsiblings.\n\u25c6\u25c6The physiological dying process for a child is very \nsimilar to that for an adult. The child\u2019s body begins to \ndemonstrate evidence of shutting down. The child\u2019s \nhands, fingers, and toes cool to the touch and the skin \ndemonstrates mottling.\n\u25c6\u25c6Dying children need support, honesty, closeness, com\u00ad\nfort, and control of their symptoms to prevent suffer\u00ad\ning. Family members are highly encouraged to touch, \ncuddle, and stay with their child.\n\u25c6\u25c6When the child is in the last 6 months of their life, the \nfamily should be referred to hospice care, in which spe\u00ad\ncially trained healthcare professionals assist the family \nin the final stages of the child\u2019s life.\n\u25c6\u25c6Traumatic deaths are a different experience than the loss \nof a child from a chronic or life-threatening condition \nfor a period of time.

Dosing may be expressed in \nterms of mg/kg/dose or mg/kg/day. If a medica\u00ad\ntion is prescribed in mg/kg/day, the pediatric nurse \nshould ask for further clarification to ensure that \neach dose is accurate.\nPediatric medications should never be prescribed \nin milliliters. The actual milligrams per milliliter \nmay be included in the prescription, but clarity of \nthe order should be in mg/kg/dose.\nExample: Give a 40 mg/kg/dose of amoxicillin to \na 3-year-old patient with severe and confirmed \nbacterial otitis media. The medication comes as a \nsuspension with a final concentration of 400 mg/5 \nmL. The child weighs 42 pounds.\na.\t Convert the pounds to kg: 42 divided by 2.2 \nequals 19.1 kg.\nb.\t Calculate the dose required in mg: 19.1 kg times \n40 mg equals 763 mg.\nc.\t Convert the dose in mg to dose in mL: 763 mg/\ndose divided by 400 mg/5 mL equals 9.5 mL of \nthe medication.\n\t\n2.\t Determining Safe Dose Ranges\nPediatric medications are given to children across \nthe developmental period. Pediatric patients can \nrun the gamut from the smallest premature in\u00ad\nfant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to \nthe adolescent who has the height and weight of \nan adult. To provide safe dosing, medications for \nchildren are administered within a safe dose range \naccording to the child\u2019s weight. For instance, the \nsteroid prednisone has a commonly published safe \ndose range of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg of weight per day for a \nchild 18 months or older, with a maintenance dose \nof 0.125 mg/kg up to 0.25 mg/kg daily. If a nurse \nreceives an order for a dose that is outside (less than \nor greater than) this common safe dose range, the \nnurse should double-check the safety of the dose \nby clarifying with the prescriber or the pharmacist \nas to why the medication was ordered outside the \nsafe dose range.\nExample: Give prednisone 11 mg PO BID to a \n19-month-old child weighing 23 kg (as a mainte\u00ad\nnance dose) with an asthma exacerbation. The nurse \nwould check the medication safe dose range for this \nchild and would find that the ordered amount per \nday (22 mg per day if it was 11 mg BID) is too high \nfor a child weighing 23 kg. The safe dose range for a \nmaintenance dose of prednisone is 0.125 mg/kg to 0.5 \nmg/kg per day (23 kg weight times the maintenance \n* The following calculations are based on this author\u2019s clinical \nexperience in giving care to children in various clinical settings \nacross the San Francisco Bay Area under the direction of various \npediatric multidisciplinary teams. Readers should use caution and \nfollow institutional policy and licensure regulations in their clinical \npractice settings. Not all providers or healthcare institutions use the \nfollowing calculations. The prescribing provider\u2019s orders must be \nfollowed, and all calculations should be double-checked for safety.\nA P P E N D I X  B\n", "of fluid stability. IV fluids are often ordered in fluid \nmaintenance calculations.\n0\u201210 kg: Child will require 100 mL per kg per \n24 hours.\n11\u201220 kg: Child will require 1000 mL plus 50 mL/kg \nfor each 1 kg over the first 10 kg per 24 hours.\n21\u201270 kg: Child will require 1500 mL plus 20 mL/kg \nfor each 1 kg over the first 20 kg per 24 hours.\nTo determine an hourly rate of fluid administra\u00ad\ntion, the nurse would calculate the entire amount \nneeded for the day and divide by 24.\nExamples: A child weighs 8 kg. The fluid maintenance \nrequirement would be 8 kg multiplied by 100 (i.e., \n800 mL of fluid) over 24 hours, or 33.3 mL per hour.\nA child weighs 13.5 kg. The fluid maintenance \nwould be 1000 mL plus 3.5 times 50; the total amount \nper day is 1175 mL per 24 hours, or 48.9 mL per hour.\nNote that fluid maintenance does not provide \nfluid resuscitation for a child with dehydration.\n\t\n6.\t Minimal Urine Output Calculation\nTo determine the minimal amount of urine required \nfor a pediatric patient, the nurse would calculate the \nrange to be between 0.5 mL/kg/hour and 2 mL/kg/\nhour for children ranging in age from infants to ado\u00ad\nlescents. This is not an acceptable amount of urine \nper day, but rather the minimal amount needed to \nshow kidney perfusion and function.\nExample: An infant weighs 12.8 kg. The minimal urine \noutput (UOP) expected per hour would be 0.5 mL/\nkg (0.5 multiplied by 12.8 equals 6.4 mL per hour).\n\t\n7.\t Kilocalorie Determinants for Children\nKilocalorie determinants include a number of fac\u00ad\ntors, including the child\u2019s health status, need for \nreduced calories for obesity, increased calories for \nfailure to thrive, and the child\u2019s amount of daily \nactivity (athletes will need more kilocalories). The \nfollowing are general guidelines for kilocalorie needs \n(other guidelines also exist):\nNewborns: 110 kilocalories per kilogram\nInfants: 90\u2012100 kilocalories per kilogram\nChildren age 5 months to 5 years: 70 kilocalories \nper kilogram\nChildren older than 5 years: 45\u201270 kilocalories \nper kilogram\nExample: A 6-month-old infant weighs 16.4 kg. This \nchild\u2019s general kilocalorie requirements per day would \nbe 70 kilocalories multiplied by the child\u2019s weight of \n16.4 kg, for a total of 1148 kilocalories per 24 hours.\nPediatric nurses should inquire about the pro\u00ad\nvider\u2019s preferences and institutional policies for \ndaily kilocalorie requirements, as they vary widely.\nsafe dose range would be between 4 mg per day up to \n8 mg per day or 2 to 4 mg per dose for BID dosing). \nThe nurse would need to clarify why 22 mg per day \nwas ordered and check whether the larger dose was \nprescribed in error.\n\t\n3.\t Safety in Drawing up the Correct Amount of \nMedication from a Multidose Container\nOnce the pediatric nurse determines the child\u2019s most \nrecent accurate weight and confirms that the pre\u00ad\nscribed medication was ordered within the safe dose \nrange, the next step in safe medication administra\u00ad\ntion is to determine how much medication to draw \nup from a multidose vial. Medications can come up \nprepared for dosing from the pharmacy (such as an \noral antibiotic in a prefilled oral syringe ready for \ndouble-checking and immediate administration), or \nthey may be found in the unit refrigerator, patient \nmedication cubby, or electronic medication dosing \nmachine (i.e., Pyxis) in multidose vials or contain\u00ad\ners. In the latter case, the nurse would need to first \ncalculate the amount that should be drawn up from \nthe multidose vial.\nExample: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 13 mg slow \nIV was ordered for a child with a significant rash at 1 \nmg/kg. The child weighs 13 kg. After double-checking \nthat the medication falls within the safe dose range, \nthe nurse takes the multidose vial of 50 mg/1 mL \nand calculates how much to safely draw up.\nDiphenhydramine 13 mg IV: Multidose vial is \n50 mg/1 mL. Drawing up 0.26 mg from the vial \nequates to 13 mg per dose: 13 mg desired divided \nby 50 mg/1 mL on hand equals to 0.26 mg per dose.\n\t\n4.\t Calculating Body Surface Areas\nSome drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents, are \nprescribed according to the child\u2019s body surface area \n(BSA). Body surface area is calculated by multiply\u00ad\ning the child\u2019s height in centimeters times weight in \nkilograms, then dividing the number by 3600, then \nsquaring the final number.\nExample: A child who weighs 16.8 kg and is 98 \ncm tall requires a maintenance dose of vincristine \n(Oncovin). The safe dose is 2 mg/m2. The child\u2019s \nBSA would be 0.68 m2: 16.8 times 97 cm, divided \nby 3600, then squared. The nurse would then de\u00ad\ntermine that the safe dose of the medication should \nbe 0.68 m2 multiplied by 2 mg, for a final dose of \n1.35 mg of vincristine.\n\t\n5.\t Fluid Maintenance Calculations\nMany children who are seen in acute, critical, emer\u00ad\ngency departments or urgent care centers require \nintravenous fluids for stabilization and maintenance \n\t\nAppendix B\u2003 18 Common Pediatric Medication and Supportive Calculations\t\n441\n", "tubing (can be found on the product packaging; \ntypically 10 gtt/mL, 15 gtt/mL, or 20 gtt/mL), then \nthat quantity multiplied by the number of minutes \nordered, equals the total amount to be administered.\nExample: A child who weighs 28 kg was located in \nthe woods after a search and rescue team found the \nchild; the child had been missing for 36 hours. First \nresponders used the drip factor calculation to give \nthe child IVF. The team used a fluid bolus resuscita\u00ad\ntion calculation of 30 mL per kilogram over 2 hours.\nChild\u2019s weight multiplied by 30 equals 840 mL.\nDrip factor tubing used is 15 gtt/mL.\nTime for the infusion is 120 minutes.\n840 times 15 divided by 120 equals 105 gtt/min.\nThe team uses a standard wristwatch to deter\u00ad\nmine the rate of 105 gtt/min and administers the \nIVF over 2 hours.\n\t 10.\t One-to-One Body Fluid Replacement\nIf a child has a drain located on the body (e.g., a \nnasogastric tube, jejunostomy tube, or bile tube) \nand is losing a quantity of body fluids, the surgeon \nmay request the child have the body fluids replaced \nas a one-to-one quantity. Typically, this amount is \ndetermined by looking back at the previous 4 hours \nof total body fluid loss, and replacing the fluid loss \nforward over the next 4 hours by dividing the quan\u00ad\ntity lost per hour.\nExample: A child on the second postoperative day \nhas a nasogastric tube set to low continuous suction. \nThe nurse has been asked to replace the fluid with \nIV lactated Ringer\u2019s solution with a 1:1 replacement \ncalculation. At 1100 hours, the nurse looks back at \nthe child\u2019s output and sees that the child has lost \n112 mL between the hours of 0700 and 1100. For \nthe hours of 1100 to 1500, the nurse would take \nthe quantity lost (112 mL), divide by 4, and run the \nlactated Ringer\u2019s IVF line at 112 mL divided by 4 \nhours, or 28 mL per hour of IVF.\n\t 11.\t Blood Transfusion Calculation\nBlood is administered to children based on a dose, \nnot in units as with adults. Children typically need \none dose to raise the hemoglobin by 1 g/dL or the \nhematocrit by 3%. A typical dose is 10 to 15 mL \nblood per kilogram. This dose may vary if the child \nis severely anemic and very symptomatic (each dose \nmay be between 3 and 8 mL/kg, and more doses \nmay be ordered to ensure a slower replacement of \nblood lost and to meet the overall dose required); \nit may also vary per institutional policy.\nExample: A school-age girl presents to the hematol\u00ad\nogy outpatient clinic with anemia; her hemoglobin \nTo determine the quantity of breast milk (20 \nkilocalories per ounce) or standard formula (20 \nkilocalories per ounce) required per day, divide the \ndaily kilocalorie requirement by 30 (mL per ounce).\nExample: A 6-month-old child weighing 16.4 kg \nrequires approximately 1148 kilocalories per day. \nDividing 1148 by 30 equals 38: that is, the child \nneeds 38 ounces of formula per day. If the infant \nfeeds 6 times per day, the general guideline would \nbe 6.3 ounces of formula for each feeding.\n\t\n8.\t Equations for Determining Fluid Resuscitation \nAfter a Burn\nWhen a child suffers a significant burn, the wound \nwill weep fluids. The emergency team may request \nthat the nursing team administer a fluid resuscita\u00ad\ntion intervention. The calculation is based on the \nchild\u2019s most accurate or estimated weight and the \npercentage of body surface burned.\nMany burn resuscitation fluid calculations are \npossible. With the Parkland formula for burn fluid \nresuscitation, the amount of intravenous fluid (IVF) \nadministered in the first 24 hours is calculated as \n4 mL of IVF per kilogram per percentage of body \nsurface burned (4 mL/kg/% burned). The first half \nof the total IVF calculated is administered in the \nfirst 8 hours, with the remainder administered over \nthe next 16 hours. Note that the percentage of body \nsurface burned is entered into the calculation as a \nwhole number.\nExample: Based on the \u201crule of nines,\u201d a child weigh\u00ad\ning 110 pounds (50 kg) has experienced the follow\u00ad\ning burns in terms of body surface area:\nEach arm: 9% (both arms burned)\nTorso: 18%\nOne leg: 18%\nTherefore the child has experienced a significant \nburn, determined to be 45% of the child\u2019s body \nsurface area.\nUsing the Parkland formula, 4 mL multiplied \nby 50 kg multiplied by 45 would equate to 9000 mL \n(9\u00a0L) of fluid needed in the first 24 hours. The team \nwould administer 4500 mL during the first 8 hours \n(562 mL/hour) and 4500 mL in the next 16 hours \n(262 mL/hour).\n\t\n9.\t Drip Factors (drops per minute)\nIf a pediatric healthcare team is providing health \ncare in a setting without electricity or electronic and \ncomputerized intravenous fluid pumps, it is com\u00ad\nmon practice to determine the rate of an IV fluid \ndose by using the drip factor equation: Amount of \nfluid ordered multiplied by the drip factor of the \n442\t\nAppendix B\u2003 18 Common Pediatric Medication and Supportive Calculations\n", "the maintenance fluids by 12% for every degree of \nfever over 37.8\u00b0C.\n\t 14.\t Dehydration Calculation\nAlthough various calculations are used to estimate \nbody fluid loss, pediatric healthcare teams who \nhave access to a recent accurate weight of a child \nprior to the fluid loss can use the following to guide \ndecision making:\nMild dehydration: approximately 5% of total body \nfluid loss (lost 5% of previous weight)\nModerate dehydration: approximately 10% of total \nbody fluid loss (lost 10% of previous weight)\nSevere dehydration: approximately 15% of total \nbody fluid loss; the child will be in a critical \nstate (lost as much as 15% of previous weight)\nExample: If a child with severe cerebral palsy has lost \n10% of his previous weight owing to fevers, diarrhea, \nand severe diaphoresis, the team may determine that \nthe child is moderately dehydrated. They will proceed \nwith fluid boluses and fluid maintenance calculations \nto provide fluid resuscitation equaling his 10% loss \n(based on his fluid maintenance requirements).\n\t 15.\t Rehydrating a Very Sick Child Who Presents with \nSignificant Dehydration\nWhen a child presents to an emergency room as \nvery sick and needing immediate rehydration, the \nteam will choose to rehydrate the child quickly to \nprevent complications. The child should receive \nboth the full fluid maintenance quantity calculated \nover 24 hours plus the percentage of fluid lost (% of \ndeficit) over a 48-hour period of time or less.\nDeficit = % dehydration \u00d7 child\u2019s weight in kilo\u00ad\ngrams \u00d7 10\nExample: A child who weighs 18 kg presents with a \n5-day history of diarrhea and vomiting. The child \nappears toxic and very sick. The team determines \nthe child to be 10% dehydrated.\nBased on the weight of 18 kg, the fluid mainte\u00ad\nnance calculation shows that the child needs 1400 \nmL over 24 hours. If the child is 10% dehydrated, \nhe needs an additional 1800 mL over 24 hours. This \nis calculated by multiplying the child\u2019s dehydration \npercent deficit (10%) times the body weight in kilo\u00ad\ngrams (18) times 10. This equals an additional 1800 \nmL on top of fluid maintenance, for a total fluid \nresuscitation need of 1400 mL + 1800 mL = 3200 \nmL over 24 hours.\n\t 16.\t Albumin Needs in the Premature Infant\nPremature infants are at risk of not receiving adequate \ndaily protein, which they need to achieve safe and \nexpected total growth before discharge. Most term \nis 6.2 g/dL and she is very symptomatic, with severe \nfatigue, tachycardia, and pallor. The hematology team \ndecides to admit her to the hospital\u2019s pediatric unit \nfor an observation status (less than 24 hours stay) \nand to give transfusions to raise her hemoglobin by \n4 g/dL. The child\u2019s current weight, as measured in \nthe clinic, is 82 pounds (37.3 kg).\nMultiplying 37.3 kg times 10 mL of blood per dose \nup to 15 mL of blood per dose gives a safe range of \n370 to 559 mL per dose. Each dose is administered \nover 4 hours. The patient\u2019s final hemoglobin was \nraised to 10.7 g/dL at discharge.\n\t 12.\t Fluid Bolus Calculation\nPediatric teams use a standard calculation when a \nchild with dehydration or fluid loss needs a rapid \nfluid bolus. The bolus is typically ordered as 30 \nmL/kg and is administered over 1 hour, with vital \nsigns taken before and after the infusion to check \nfor improved clinical status. The overall time of ad\u00ad\nministration of a fluid bolus can vary depending on \nthe team\u2019s decision, the fragile nature of the child, \nand the child\u2019s age and weight.\nExample: An infant presents with recent history of \nhigh fevers, poor oral intake, and vomiting. The child \nis lethargic and has a delayed capillary refill time of \n2 to 3 seconds. The team orders a STAT IVF bolus \nof 0.9% normal saline (NS) over 1 hour, repeated \nas necessary to see clinical improvement and he\u00ad\nmodynamic stabilization. The infant weighs 7.2 kg.\nTo calculate the dose, the nurse multiplies 7.2 \nkg times 30 mL per bolus, which equals 216 mL \nof 0.9% NS over 1 hour, followed by reassessment.\n\t 13.\t High Fevers and Calculation of Body Fluid Loss\nIf a child has had several high fever spikes, the team \nmay decide to take into account the fluids lost per \ndegree of fever over the child\u2019s normal body tempera\u00ad\nture. The calculation assumes 7 mL of fluid lost per \ndegree of fever over normal per hour, every 4 hours.\nExample: A child with a series of high fevers from \nacute bacterial gastroenteritis requires a fluid bolus, \nmaintenance fluids, and an extra quantity of IVF \nbased on fever history. The child\u2019s temperature has \nbeen 39.0\u00b0C four times in the last 24 hours. The \nchild weighs 19 kg.\nThe nurse multiplies 7 mL times 2 degrees of \nfever over the child\u2019s base line temperature. This \nequates to an additional 14 mL of fluid resuscitation \nper hour over the next 4 hours, repeated as needed.\nA more aggressive fluid replacement for a febrile \nchild is suggested by Cellucci (2014). In this pro\u00ad\ntocol, the care provider is encouraged to increase \n\t\nAppendix B\u2003 18 Common Pediatric Medication and Supportive Calculations\t\n443\n", "by dividing the child\u2019s weight in kilograms by the \nsquare of the child\u2019s height in meters (weight divided \nby height2). The final BMI calculated is then used to \ndetermine the percentile in which the child fits on \na standardized BMI growth chart. For instance, if \na child\u2019s BMI is less than the plotted 5th percentile, \nthe child is considered underweight; if it is in the\u00a05th \nto 85th percentiles, the child is considered in the \nhealthy weight category; and if it is greater than the \n95th percentile, the child is considered obese. BMI \ngrowth charts are available on the Centers for Dis\u00ad\nease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2015) website.\nExample: An 11-year-old boy presents to the clinic \nwith a weight of 108 pounds (49.1 kg) and a height \nof 52 inches (130 cm).\nThe calculation would be:\n1 foot equals 12 inches or 3.3048 meters\n1 inch equals 0.025 meter\nChild\u2019s height: 52 inches or 1.3 meters (0.025 \u00d7 52)\nChild\u2019s weight: 49.1 kg\nDivide 49.1 kg by the height in meters squared (1.69)\nChild\u2019s BMI: 49.1 kg/1.69 m2 = 29\nThe BMI of 29 places this 11-year-old boy in the \n96th percentile on a CDC BMI growth chart.

Premature or small infants can \ntake much longer to regain this weight (Thureen \n& Heird, 2005).\nMost infants who, for instance, require a 12- to \n16-week NICU admission do not achieve the 2\u20123 \nkg body mass increase desired. Premature infants \nneed adequate protein intake to support protein \nsynthesis, adequate growth patterns, and net protein \nbalance, and to support normal cellular function by \nway of signaling molecules (Hay & Thureen, 2010).\nProtein requirements at 24 to 30 weeks\u2019 gestation \nare as high as 4 g/kg/day, but then decrease to 2 to \n3 g/kg/day at term.\n\t 17.\t Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy Infusion \nProtocols and Calculations\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is \nadministered to help support children who have \none of more than 150 medical immunodeficiency \ndiagnoses that are affected by the production and \nfunction of immunoglobulins (antibodies). Each \ndose, which is pooled from donor immunoglobu\u00ad\nlin G (IgG) antibodies, contains 10,000 to 60,000 \nunits of donated plasma. Due to concerns about \nreactions to IVIG administration, pediatric nurses \nuse a \u00adcalculation to determine the small amount of \nproduct per kilogram that should be infused over \na short time frame to assess for early symptoms \nof reactions (e.g., fever, headache, myalgia, rash, \n\u00adarthralgia, and hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylaxis) and the need for future premedications \n(e.g., acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and steroids).\nExample: A child with a primary IgG immunodefi\u00ad\nciency requires an IVIG infusion, to be administered \nover 4 hours, or per a protocol where the product is \nadministered very slowly for the first 5 minutes, with \nquantities then increasing in small milliliter incre\u00ad\nments every 5 to 10 minutes. Vital signs should be \nchecked before each increase in volume is delivered.\n\t 18.\t Body Mass Index (Quetelet Index) Expressed as \nkg/m2\nPediatric healthcare team members may need to \ncalculate a child\u2019s body mass index (BMI) to deter\u00ad\nmine if the child\u2019s overall body size is appropriate \nfor age, growth, and development.

The information provides a visual \ndiagram of percentile curves that show a distribution of \na child\u2019s body measurements. First created in 1977, these \ncharts help a pediatric healthcare team determine whether \nan infant\u2019s, child\u2019s, or adolescent\u2019s growth is adequate. \nPlots on a nationally standardized growth chart are not \ndiagnostic in value, but rather provide trends to assist a \nteam in decision making.\nThere are now a total of 16 charts (8 charts for each sex), \nincluding the latest addition of body mass index-for-age \ncharts.

Other institutional-wide hand\u00ad\noffs occur when transporting the pediatric patient from \none department to another (i.e., emergency department \n[ED] to pediatric intensive care unit [PICU], PICU to \nthe pediatric unit, pediatric acute care unit [PACU] to \nthe pediatric unit, pediatric unit to magnetic resonance \nimaging [MRI]).\nNo matter how a healthcare institution selects its \npreferred best practices, the responsibility of giving and \ngetting patient information is considered an essential \naspect of quality care. Legally, nurses are responsible \nfor providing information to the oncoming nurse that \nallows the next nurse to effectively provide care with \ncontinuity.\nExcellence in pediatric handoffs takes planning, \nthoughtfulness, critical thinking, respect, and practice. \nA formal handoff is a collaborative effort; without it, \nthe nurse and the healthcare institution can be liable for \ncare failures (Logsdon, 2014). Some institutions, such as \nBoston Children\u2019s Hospital, have reported significant \nreductions in medical errors (from 32% of admissions \nto 19%) by formalizing handoffs (Logsdon, 2014).

Typically those who \nrespond are either the full code team, a partial code team, or \nspecific team members such as the pediatric intensive care unit \n(PICU) charge nurse, PICU hospitalist, and the emergency \ndepartment (ED) primary provider. The goals are to rapidly \nrespond to any concern about the safety and status of a child, \nto escalate the concern to those who have the advanced skills \nneeded to assess and respond to the child\u2019s condition, and to \nprevent a code blue. The rapid response phone number may \nbe unique, or it may be the same as the code blue number.\nEvidence-Based Practice\nResearch has shown that the use of rapid response teams \nwith members who have specialized skills significantly \nreduces the rate of in-hospital code blue events and the \nnumber of unplanned intensive care transfers (Dacey et\u00a0al., \n2007). The current rate of pediatric survival to discharge \nafter an in-hospital code blue event is 16% (Ray et\u00a0al., \n2009). Rapid response teams, including early activation of \nthese teams by families, have been shown to decrease full \npediatric codes, to decrease mortality, and to decrease the \nduration of pediatric clinical instability (Ray et\u00a0al., 2009).\nCode Blue Skills\nThe activation of a code blue button or a call to the code blue \nphone line should initiate a rapid response by a designated \nteam of advanced responders. This team comes as quickly \nas possible, often avoiding elevators, and provides lifesaving \nassistance when a child is experiencing a respiratory arrest, \nsevere respiratory distress, shock, cardiovascular arrest, or \na combination of these conditions. Responders can include \nthe PICU hospitalist, PICU nurse, respiratory therapist, \npharmacist, anesthesiologist, nursing supervisor, surgery \nrepresentative, emergency room charge nurse, and a central \nsupply representative who can coordinate bringing a new \nstocked crash cart if the primary one is opened and sup\u00ad\nplies exhausted. A laboratory assistant may also be a part of \nthe team to run specimens to the lab for rapid evaluation.\nCode blue response skills include the following (not in \norder of priority):\n\u2022\t Rapid assessment, determination of need, and ini\u00ad\ntiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n\u2022\t Care of the family present\n\u2022\t Application of cardiac leads and cardiac monitoring\n\u2022\t Placement of a firm backboard to increase the \n\u00adeffectiveness of chest compressions\n\u2022\t Frequent vital signs assessment\n\u2022\t Initiation of IV access, fluid boluses, and laboratory \nanalysis\n\u2022\t Ability and skill to use a length-based color-coded \npediatric resuscitation tape\n\u2022\t Accurate confirmation of the child\u2019s cardiac \ndysrhythmia\n\u2022\t Use of code blue algorithms to determine \nresearch-based interventions\n\u2022\t Advanced skills in medication preparation and safe \nadministration\nA P P E N D I X  H\n", "bedside pediatric early warning system of communication \nvia a scoring system, all centered around a theme of safe \nearly warning to prevent a child from experiencing poor \nclinical outcomes or death.\nThe PEWS tool consists of three categories: behavior, \ncardiovascular, and respiratory status. Each of these three \ncategories is assessed according to the child\u2019s severity on \nseven specific objective measures: heart rate, systemic \nblood pressure, capillary refill time (CRT), respiratory \nrate, respiratory effort, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, \nand oxygen therapy. The final score ranges from 0 to 9. \nReporting of scoring varies per healthcare institution. \nAlways follow your institution\u2019s policies carefully, and never \nhesitate to call for an assessment or call for help.\nScoring Guidelines\n0\u20122 = Child is stable\n3 = Reassess; report findings to hospitalist and charge \nnurse; document and reassess frequently\n4 = Notify hospitalist and charge nurse; consider re\u00ad\nspiratory therapist evaluation; reassess frequently\n5 = Notify hospitalist, charge nurse, and call respiratory \ntherapist immediately; consider a rapid response\n6 = Consider transfer to a higher level of care; call for \na rapid response team\n7 = Call for a rapid response team; transfer to a higher \nlevel of care\n\u2022\t Team work and leadership\n\u2022\t Accurate documentation\n\u2022\t Code blue response team debriefing\nEvidence-Based Practice\nPredetermined team member roles, team organization, \nuninterrupted and timely high-quality CPR, rapid \ndefibrillation, and the correction of identified revers\u00ad\nible causes of the need for resuscitation efforts lead to \nan effective code blue team (Prince, Hines, Chyou, & \nHeegeman, 2014). Regular practice of code blue response \nskills via simulations and mock code blue scenarios has \nbeen shown to increase staff confidence, improve patient \noutcomes, and reduce child morbidity and mortality \n(Corey, 2016).\nBedside PEWS Tool\nThe pediatric early warning score (PEWS) system was \ndeveloped to provide an objective evaluation of a child \nwho may require a team response due to a deteriorating \nclinical status (Parshuram, Hutchison, & Middaugh, 2009). \nThe goal when applying the bedside PEWS tool is to use \ninformation that is collected in what is considered a routine \nclinical assessment by various team members, with the \noutcome being a decision to intervene or transfer the child \nto a higher level of care.

Patients can expect \na nurse to act in their best interests and to respect their \ndignity. This means that a nurse abstains from obtaining \npersonal gain at the patient\u2019s expense and refrains from \ninappropriate involvement with a patient or the patient\u2019s \nfamily members.\n\u2014National Council of State Boards of Nursing (2017)\nCaring for Families with Healthy \nBoundaries\nA very special relationship can develop between a pedi\u00ad\natric nurse and his or her patients. During the course of \nproviding intimate assessments, symptom management, \neducation, and support, it is possible for a professional \nrelationship to become transformed into a true friend\u00ad\nship. Nevertheless, it is the best interest of the nurse and \nthe family to maintain professional boundaries so that the \ntherapeutic nurse\u2012patient relationship is not jeopardized \nand trust continues to grow. This is not always easy to do \nwhen families are cared for over a long period of time and \ndeep relationships develop. To be therapeutic and effective, \nthe professional nurse must set goals for the patient and \nfamily that are upheld while maintaining their privacy and \ndignity. Sensitive information about a child\u2019s health history \nor family dynamics must be kept in confidence and remain \nin the professional workplace.\nAccording to the National Council of State Boards of \nNursing (2014), nurses may describe their care as being \n\u201cunder-involved, therapeutic, or over-involved.\u201d Obvi\u00ad\nously, the \u201ctherapeutic\u201d level of care is the goal. To ensure \nthe nurse meets this standard, it is important to be able to \nidentify when boundaries are blurred.\nOffering Support Outside of Work\nThe therapeutic relationship should not extend beyond \nthe workplace. According to the National Council of State \nBoards of Nursing (2014), red flags include the following:\n\u2022\t Sharing personal information or intimate details of \none\u2019s life and relationships between the patient, the \npatient\u2019s family, and the nurse\n\u2022\t Spending more time with the patient than is re\u00ad\nquired for professional nursing care\n\u2022\t Meeting patients and families outside of work\n\u2022\t Any display of favoritism or asking to care for a \nfamily when it is not an appropriate assignment\n\u2022\t Continuing a relationship with the child and family \nafter the patient is discharged\nNot Taking Photos or Filming Children\nThe use of cell phones to take photographs of a child or \nfamily is a direct violation of the child\u2019s and family\u2019s right \nto privacy and should be avoided\u2014no matter how cute the \nchild is. This practice violates institutional policies and can \nlead to loss of employment and legal ramifications.

This sort of behavior is a relatively new \nviolation of boundaries, and it can prove very tempting \nwhen the family encourages the nurse to post the comments. \nWhether the posting of pictures or information about a \nchild or their family takes place during work hours or at \nhome, it is a direct violation of privacy and confidentiality \nand can lead to the loss of employment.\nAttending Funerals\nMany healthcare professionals are invited to attend the \nfuneral services of patients for whom they have cared over \na period of time.

Breast milk is sterile, is abundant, and provides \nantibodies to help protect the child from pneumonia, oti\u00ad\ntis media, and diarrhea. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) encourages exclusive breastfeeding until the child \nis 6 months of age, with breastfeeding then continuing, with \nappropriate complementary foods, until the child\u2019s second \nbirthday. Breastfeeding should begin within 1 hour of birth, \npacifiers and bottles should be avoided, and breastfeeding \nshould occur on demand throughout the night and day.\nBreast milk provides components not found in com\u00ad\nmercially prepared infant formulas. Specifically, it contains \nlactoferrin, secretory immunoglobulins (IgA), white blood \ncells, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates\u2014\nall of which collectively represent the perfect nutrition for \ninfants, provide protective components against infection \n(e.g., respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, and \nnecrotizing enterocolitis), and promote brain development. \nBreast milk has been shown to improve visual acuity and \nlead to larger amounts of brain white matter and gray matter \n(important for memory, speech, learning, decision mak\u00ad\ning, and self-control), larger head circumference, higher \nneurocognitive test scores, improved motor development, \nand overall better health and wellness (Belfort et\u00a0al., 2016; \nGrace, Oddy, Bulsara, & Hands, 2017; Tawia, 2013).\nBreastfeeding has both health and social benefits for \nthe mother. It helps protect women against ovarian cancer, \nbreast cancer, diabetes type 1, and postpartum depression, \nIn addition, it provides up to 98% natural (although not \nguaranteed) birth control for the first 6 months after delivery.\nThe skill of breastfeeding must be learned, and a woman \nshould be provided support to initiate and continue breast\u00ad\nfeeding her infant. Workplaces should give nursing mothers \na place and time for expressing breast milk, as well as a \nstorage area for the breast milk (WHO, 2017).\nWhen a child cannot breastfeed, or when a mother \ncannot or chooses not to breastfeed, infant formula must \nbe provided. No other substance should be given to an \ninfant younger than 6 months.\nInfant Formula Overview\n\u2022\t Infant formulas should be commercially produced, \nnot made at home from other substances (e.g., \ncow\u2019s or goat\u2019s milk and sugar or honey).\n\u2022\t Three types of formulas are currently available: \npremixed liquids, liquid concentrations that require \ndilution, and powders.\n\u2022\t Infant formulas are provided in the following \n\u00adgeneral types:\n\u25c6\u25c6Cow\u2019s milk protein-based formulas\n\u25c6\u25c6Soy-based formulas\n\u25c6\u25c6Protein hydrolysate (broken down into compo\u00ad\nnent amino acids for infants with protein aller\u00ad\ngies to cow\u2019s milk or soy-based formulas)\n\u2022\t Infants need iron; an iron-fortified formula should \nbe used for feeding an infant unless instructed oth\u00ad\nerwise by the primary care provider.\n\u2022\t Cow\u2019s milk formulas contain lactose, milk proteins \n(whey and casein), and minerals, along with veg\u00ad\netable oils and vitamins.\nA P P E N D I X  J\n", "\u25c6\u25c6The total number of formula feeds will decrease \nas the child grows older, and the quantity of each \nfeed will increase to 6 to 8 ounces.\n\u25c6\u25c6At 6 months, the infant may be ready to start \nsolid foods (i.e., baby cereals), but the amount \nof formula should not decrease until the infant \nshows mastery of oral solid foods.\n\u25c6\u25c6If the geographical area where the family lives \ndoes not have tap water with fluoride, prescribed \nfluoride will need to be administered.\nThe pediatric nurse should be a breastfeeding advocate. \nIn fact, the pediatric nurse can have a positive impact on \nbreastfeeding initiation and continuation (Robinson, 2016).\nBibliography\nBelfort, M.

How we communicate with \nchildren, therefore, should be based on a foundation of \nunderstanding of growth and development for each of \nthe five developmental stages: infancy, toddler, preschool, \nschool age, and adolescence.\nPediatric nurses might find themselves challenged \nregarding how to start a relationship with a child in a \nclinical setting, and then further challenged about how to \nmaintain that relationship. Children are often frightened of \nnurse-related procedures involving injections and needles \n(Karlsson, Rydstr\u00f6m, Ensk\u00e4r, & Englund, 2014). Conse\u00ad\nquently, it is important for the nurse to see each individual \nchild as a unique person and understand his or her specific \nperspective. The uniqueness of the patient\u2013nurse relation\u00ad\nship in pediatrics should be based on trust, respect, and \nkindness. A child should be honored during communication \nexchanges, he or she should never be belittled or judged, \nand the interaction should not be full of power struggles. \nWith study, foresight, and experience, the pediatric nurse \nwill develop his or her own ways of engaging with children \nfrom infancy to adolescence, while maintaining a playful \nbut professional role in the healthcare team.\nThe following subsections provide tips for successful \ncommunication with children across the developmental \nstages.\nYoung Infancy\n1.\t Show trust. Approach the young infant slowly and \ngently.\n2.\t Use a quiet, kind voice; sing to the infant; smile and \nhold the infant close to your face so the infant\u2019s im\u00ad\nmature eyes can focus on you.\n3.\t Provide a quiet and consistent environment; take \ncare of the young infant\u2019s basic needs.\n4.\t By 4 months of age, young infants will know that \nwhen they make a noise, people look and respond. \nThis interaction gives infants pleasure.\nOlder Infancy\n1.\t Start slowly, but show the growing infant that \nyou and the parents have a positive and trusting \nrelationship.\n2.\t When approaching an older infant, talk to and smile \nto the parents first.\n3.\t Babble to the infant and encourage return of vo\u00ad\ncal sounds. Give positive reinforcement when the \ninfant relates to you.\n4.\t Remember that stranger anxiety and separation \nanxiety start in this developmental period. Be sen\u00ad\nsitive to older infants\u2019 dismay.\nToddler\n1.\t Know that tantrumming and saying \u201cNO!\u201d is ex\u00ad\npected and normal for this developmental period.\n2.\t Offer just a few (limited) choices when possible. \nDo not allow the child to \u201crun the show.\u201d Say, \u201cDo \nyou want your medication with orange juice or \ncherry syrup?\u201d\n3.\t Give simple consequences for unwanted behaviors \n(taking a break from a movie until medications \nare taken).\n4.\t Talk to children at their level; crouch down if pos\u00ad\nsible and look the child in the eye.\nA P P E N D I X  K\n", "Adolescence\n1.\t Teenagers enjoy talking about their lives, activities, \nand friendships.\n2.\t Not all teens will want to establish a friendly rela-\ntionship with their pediatric nurse.\n3.\t Good conversational openers start with conveying \na genuine interest in the teen\u2019s life, health, relation-\nships, and accomplishments.\n4.\t When shy, teens may respond to an offer to play a \ngame or do a craft.\n5.\t Teens may want more concrete information about \ntheir diagnosis.\n6.\t Silence should be respected and honored.\n7.\t Time alone and privacy should be offered.\nOverall\n\u2022\t Smile infectiously.\n\u2022\t Include all family members.\n\u2022\t Never break a promise.\n\u2022\t Never say, \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d or \u201cYou are too big to cry.\u201d\n\u2022\t Never compare children to each other.\n\u2022\t Use silence; it is okay.\nBibliography\nFastaff Travel Nursing.

The application \nof theory guides the pediatric nurse to not only predict \nthe behaviors and developmental progression of a child, \nbut also understand why children behave the way they do. \nTheories are intended to help make sense of individual \nhuman behavior and the world in which individuals live. \nIn particular, developmental theories provide a structure \non which to plan care for children and predict behavioral \noutcomes.\nErik Erikson (1902\u20131994): \nGerman Scholar\nCreated the psychosocial developmental theory.\n\u2022\t Childhood\u2019s social interactions have the greatest \ninfluence over full development.\n\u2022\t Humans pass through eight stages of development, \nfrom infancy to geriatrics.\n\u2022\t Mastery of the positive nature of each stage of \nconflict must occur for the child to function well \nduring further growth and development, the stages \nfinally ending with death.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 1: Infancy\u2014trust versus mistrust. An \ninfant needs continuity, consistency, and reas\u00ad\nsurance that the world is a safe place. Mistrust \ndevelops when the child feels rejected, is harmed, \nor has few needs met.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 2: Toddler\u2014autonomy versus shame and \ndoubt. A young child needs encouragement \nto try skills and tasks without feeling shamed. \nOtherwise, children may develop the feelings \nthat they cannot act on their own and doubt \ntheir abilities.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 3: Preschool age\u2014initiative versus guilt. \nThe child needs to have positive reinforcement of \nnew skills and new responsibilities through en\u00ad\ncouragement. The child needs to feel purposeful \nthrough play.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 4: School age\u2014industry versus inferior\u00ad\nity. Growing children need to learn how to act \nand perform in school, feeling that they have the \nskills and abilities to accomplish what is expected \nof them. Feelings of inferiority develop when \nthey do not feel accepted or able.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 5: Adolescence\u2014self-identity versus role \nconfusion. Teens need to develop a sense of \nwho they are and what their purpose in life is. \nTheir self-image is based on what they have \nlearned and how they see themselves able to \nbe successful. Role confusion occurs when \nthere are poor role models, poor communica\u00ad\ntion, and uncertainty about the teen\u2019s place in \nsociety.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 6: Young adult\u2014intimacy versus isolation. \nThe young adult needs to have a sense of value in \nintimate relationships (siblings, friends, lovers, \nand partners) versus a feeling of isolation with\u00ad\nout commitment.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 7: Middle age\u2014generativity versus stagna\u00ad\ntion. The middle adulthood period is the time of \nless selfishness and more concern for children, \nfamily, society, and the future.\nA P P E N D I X  L\n", "Jean Piaget (1896\u20131990): Swiss Scholar\nCreated the cognitive developmental theory.\n\u2022\t The cognitive developmental theory explains the \ndevelopment of children\u2019s thought processes, men\u00ad\ntal status, and knowledge (epistemology),\n\u2022\t How a child\u2019s thought processes develop influences \nhow the child interacts with the world.\n\u2022\t The theory assumes that children do not think the \nway adults do, but rather think differently.\n\u2022\t The theory provides a sequence of steps to cognitive \ndevelopment:\n\u25c6\u25c6Step 1: sensory motor. The infant uses the \nsenses and motor exploration to learn about the \nenvironment.\n\u25c6\u25c6Step 2: preoperational. The toddler and the pre\u00ad\nschooler learn about symbols, creative play, and \nmanipulation while tending to be egotistical in \ntheir thinking; that is, they lack the ability to see \nthe world from another\u2019s point of view or under\u00ad\nstand other people\u2019s feelings.\n\u25c6\u25c6Step 3: concrete operational. The school-age \nchild focuses on logical operations and specific \nprinciples to solve problems and learn about the \nacademic world.\n\u25c6\u25c6Step 4: Formal operational. The older school-age \nchild and teen become more adult-like in their \nthinking; they start to use hypothetical thinking \nand early abstract thinking.\nLawrence Kohlberg (1927\u20131987): \nAmerica Scholar\n\u2022\t Kohlberg proposed a theory on how children grow \ninto moral beings.\n\u2022\t He based his theory on three levels of moral devel\u00ad\nopment spanning childhood:\n\u25c6\u25c6Level 1: Preconventional. During the young \nchildhood years, the child has little to no sense \nof what is considered right or wrong behavior. \nMotivation comes from wanting to avoid punish\u00ad\nment and securing rewards.\n\u25c6\u25c6Level 2: Conventional. During the school age years, \nthe child knows what is wrong or right and tends \nto want to follow rules through respecting author\u00ad\nity. Children of this age have a strong sense of what \nothers around them want of their behaviors.\n\u25c6\u25c6Level 3: Postconventional. During the teenage \nyears, children develop individual principles to \nguide their moral behavior. Motivation comes \nentirely from within but is influenced by the sig\u00ad\nnificant adults in their lives.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 8: Elder years\u2014self-actualization versus \ndespair. The older adult will experience a sense \nof coming to terms with his or her life and not \nfearing death, versus feelings of uselessness and \npersonal despair.\nSigmund Freud (1856\u20131939): \nAustrian Neurologist\nAuthored the grand theory of psychosexual development.\n\u2022\t The grand theory of psychosexual development is \nbased on a series of stages representing the conflicts \nthe child must satisfy as part of libidinal desire. The \nvarious stages play a significant role in the child\u2019s \ndevelopment. If children do not complete a psycho\u00ad\nsexual stage, they will become fixated, which later \ninfluences their adult behaviors.\n\u2022\t The pleasure-seeking energy (id) focuses on specific \nerogenous areas of the body, whereas the ego at\u00ad\ntempts to mediate and control the id\u2019s demands.\n\u2022\t Successful mastery and completion of each stage \nleads to a healthy personality in adulthood.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 1: Infancy\u2014erogenous zone is the mouth \n(oral). The infant experiences the oral passive \nstage during the first 6 months after birth, and \nthe oral aggressive stage during the second 6 \nmonths. The infant obtains stimulation through \nsucking and tasting and obtaining comfort from \noral sensations.\n\u25c6\u25c6Stage 2: Toddler\u2014erogenous zone is the bowel \nand bladder control (anal). The primary focus \nof the libido during this phase in on controlling \nelimination. Parental leniency can lead to an \nanal-expulsive personality, which then develops \ninto a destructive personality. Parental control or \nstrictness can lead to an anal-retentive personal\u00ad\nity, which is characterized by an obsessive, or\u00ad\nderly, and rigid nature.
